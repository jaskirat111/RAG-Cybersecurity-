"A Pune-based businessman lost Rs 8.86 lakh to cyber fraudsters after he contacted a mobile phone number displayed on a website which claimed to provide air ticket cancellation services.
The businessman, who is a 59-year-old resident of Kothrud, lodged aFirst Information Report(FIR) on Wednesday at the Kothrud police station.

The person who received his call asked for his bank and debit card details. Once the businessman shared his bank and debit card information, he was further asked to download an online application on his mobile phone.
After he downloaded the application, Rs 8.86 lakh was transferred from his bank account to two other bank accounts through net banking on July 15.
The businessman then realised that he had been scammed and contacted the bank authorities and the cyber police station to complain about the unauthorised transactions from his account.
An investigation revealed that when the businessman downloaded the mobile application, the cyber fraudsters got “remote access” of his mobile phone and without his knowledge and consent, added two “beneficiaries”, identified as Ismail and Sohail, to his bank account.
The cyber fraudsters transferred the money to Ismail and Sohail through multiple online transactions.
The police have launched a probe and said said the unidentified online scammers in this case have been booked under Sections 319 (2) (cheating by personation) and 318 (4) (fraudulently deceiving people) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and sections of the Information Technology Act.

"A Delhi Court Saturday sent three persons who allegedly committed a trans-national cyber crime, in which foreign nationals were targeted and defrauded, to CBI custody for four days. Forty others who were also allegedly involved in the crime were sent to judicial custody till August 9.
“So far as accused Dhruv Khattar, Dhairya Khattar and Tushar Arora are concerned, to unearth the conspiracy and to gather evidence, their custodial interrogation is necessary,” Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate (ACJM) Nishant Garg said while sending the three persons to CBI custody.
It was alleged by theCBI that the accused persons operated illegal call centersfrom New Delhi and adjoining areas and subjected US nationals to fraud by using pseudonymous identities ofMicrosoftofficials. The central probe agency also alleged that transactions worth 15 million US dollars were involved in this case.
A US citizen, Michelle Finch, was cheated of 6.5 million dollars on November 24, 2022, alleged the agency. An accused, impersonating a Microsoft employee, made Finch open two bank accounts in J P Morgan Chase Bank and City Bank and transferred 6.5 million US dollars to 16 Hong Kong-based bank accounts, as per the CBI.
It all started when Finch received a pop-up on her computer screen displaying a phone number. On contacting the phone number, a person impersonated a Microsoft Tech Support representative and informed her that her identity had been hacked.
The CBI also alleged that the accused persons were in contact with each other through Signal Messaging App using 46 mobile numbers of different Indian Service Providers. Illegal calls were made from areas associated with five IP addresses of New Delhi, Noida and Gurgaon, the agency further alleged.
Seeking custody of Dhruv, Dhairya and Arora for seven days, the CBI said that “crucial incriminating evidence directly linking the accused persons with the crime were recovered from the personal vehicle of accused Dhairya.”
Arora, the agency said, worked as a Cloud Support Engineer at the call center and played a “very crucial role in perpetrating trans-national cyber crime.”
For seeking judicial custody of the other 40 persons, the CBI submitted that the investigation was at a very nascent and crucial stage and that it needed to find the whereabouts of the other accused persons along with the flow of the proceeds of crime.
In a jam-packed room at Rouse Avenue Court, the counsel of the accused persons argued that they were not provided with a copy of theFIRor the remand application. They also argued that the accused persons were not informed of the grounds of arrest.
“Considering the trans-national character and gravity of the offence; the fact that the investigation is at very early stage; to prevent the accused persons from tampering with the evidence, influencing the witnesses, repeating the offence and for expeditious and fair investigation, they are required to be remanded to judicial custody,” ACJM Garg said while sending 40 accused persons to judicial custody and rejecting the arguments of their lawyers.

"Three police officers attached to Hari Nagar cyber police station in New Delhi have been suspended after they were booked for alleged bribery and extortion in a complaint filed by a student of Amity University who was ‘falsely implicated’ in an OTP fraud case in 2023, the police said on Friday.
The police at the Vigilance Station registered a case against Sub-Inspector Brijesh Redhu, Head Constable Satish Kumar and Head Constable Anil Yadav on July 10 under sections 384 (extortion) and 34 of IPC and section 7 (bribery) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
“The police officers have been suspended, as the investigation is ongoing,” Virender Sharma, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Vigilance wing of the Delhi Police, said on Friday.
Apart from framing a false case against him, the university student, Suson Adhikary, also accused the officers of beating him, his brother and his friend Aditya Raj and demanding Rs 40 lakh to “settle the case”.
According to theFirst Information Report(FIR), the 19-year-old student who was running an e-commerce company named Adhikary Media OPC Private Ltd was summoned to the Tilak Nagar Police station on March 10, based on a complaint by a customer who allegedly lost Rs 27,000 after she called up the Adhikary firm customer care to register a complaint. The complainant and Suson, along with his brother Sulav Adhikary and friend Aditya Raj were sent to the Hari Nagar station.
According to the FIR, SI Redhu abused Suson accusing him of OTP fraud and then asked his colleague Satish to beat him. “Satish then slapped and punched Suson multiple times. He then checked Suson’s phone gallery which had photographs of his girlfriend and passed vulgar comments on her. He also thrashed Sulav till he bled. SI Brijesh then checked Suson’s and Aditya’s company accounts and asked them to pay Rs 25 lakh if they want to be released. He also threatened to arrest Suson’s mother, on whose name his company is registered,” the complainant said, adding that Brijesh soon increased his demand to Rs 40 lakh.
The policemen sent Suson, along with Sulav, to get the cash from his home, and the men returned with Rs 7.5 lakh and handed over the cash to the officers in a bag. The police kept the three in police custody.
The next morning (March 11), around 5 am, Brijesh told Suson, who was detained in the station, that his father had filed a missing complaint at Mandawali police station and sent him home to bring the remaining amount.
Suson, using his savings, his mother’s credit card and a friend’s account, managed to pay Rs 19.5 lakh to the officers, after which all three of them were allowed to leave, the FIR alleged.
On March 11, at around 11 pm Suson got a call from Brijesh threatening him not to reveal anything about the extortion at the police station.
“They thought we were young and took us for a ride,” said Aditya Raj.
The police ordered an inquiry into the incident on April 20, 2023, based on Suson’s complaint at DCP West Delhi, Vigilance on March 13. Suson and Sulav have applied for an anticipatory bail.

"A special PMLA court in Ranchi on Saturday convicted five Jamtara residents under the anti-money laundering law for running an “organised” cyber crime syndicate, official sources said.
A Netflix series named “Jamtara” that streamed in 2020 is said to have been based on real-life incidents of phishing phone calls and bank accounts scamming launched by some criminals from this district giving it the moniker of ‘cyber crime capital’ for many years.
Police and other probe agencies later went full steam against these criminals, many of whom were youngsters.
Official sources told PTI those convicted under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) include Ganesh Mandal (51), his son Pradeep Kumar Mandal (30), Santosh Mandal (51) and his sons Pintu Mandal (33) and Ankush Kumar Mandal (27).
The quantum of sentence is expected to be announced by the court on July 23, the sources said.
The federal probe agency had filed a charge sheet against the five accused in May, 2019.
The ED slapped criminal charges under the PMLA against these cyber criminals after taking cognisance of a Jharkhand PoliceFIRand charge sheet that charged them with illegal withdrawal and transfer of money from the ATMs/bank accounts of gullible people in guise of being a bank official.
The ED had said its investigation found that the accused “in connivance with other persons acquired funds in their bank accounts and family member’s bank accounts by cheating the bank customers, some other individuals and invested the same in the construction of houses and purchase of vehicles.”

"Cyber fraudsters recently allegedly hacked the server of a commercial bank in Noida’s Sector 62 to steal Rs 16.71 crore, said the police. They added that this major breach was accomplished by hacking into the bank’s server and transferring the money to 84 different accounts.
The fraud at Nainital Bank Limited came to light during a routine reconciliation of the bank’s balance sheet. The bank’s IT Manager, Sumit Shrivastava, noticed a discrepancy of Rs 3,60,94,020 in the RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement) account on June 17 while reviewing the balance sheets.
Following this, Srivastava filed a case with the Noida Cyber Crime Police Station on July 10 under Indian Penal Code sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) and 66C (fraudulent use of electronic signature) and requestedassistance from CERT-IN(Indian Computer Emergency Response Team) to investigate the matter.
Station House Officer Umesh Chandra Naithani toldthe Indian Expressthat the complaint had been filed on the NCRB portal earlier, but anFIRwas registered only on July 10 while he was stationed there.
Additional Commissioner of Police, Cyber Noida, Vivek Ranjan Rai, said that some unidentified men had hacked the bank manager’s login ID and password and transferred the amount to 89 different accounts. “We have formed a special investigation team to look into the matter,” said the ACP.
Shrivastava said that after finding the discrepancies in the RTGS account, the team verified the CBS(Core Banking System) transactions with the SFMS( Structured Financial Messaging system), which was not tallying. The team felt this was due to some issue in the bank system. However, on June 20, it was confirmed that 84 instances of suspicious transactions had occurred between June 17 and June 21.

The fraudsters convinced her that she needed to obtain a clearance certificate to prove her non-involvement in sending the package and also warned her that under the new National Security Act (NSA), disclosing information about the case could lead to her own detention for questioning.
They further claimed that they were investigating a money laundering case related to the package and that she would need to transfer funds to a bank account to clear her name. They assured her that the transferred money would be deposited in an RBI-managed account and returned after the case was resolved.

"For Shiv Shankar Saha, a call to update his electricity bill seemed like a regular one from customer care. It was only after the call ended that the 67-year-old realised that a whopping sum of nearly Rs 6 lakh had been charged to his credit card.
On June 16, Saha, a doctor and a resident of Safdarjung Enclave, registered a complaint on the National Cybercrime Reporting Portal (NCRP) alleging he received a call to update his BSES electricity bill. The caller asked him to pay a nominal amount of Rs 10 for updating the bill and Saha paid with his HSBC credit card.
During the call, police said the accused allegedly used a remote access app — which lets one control other devices from your own — to virtually access Saha’s phone while he was entering his credit card details into it.
Once the call was disconnected, Saha found three transactions of Rs 1,98,221.40 each were done with his card. Police then registered anFIRunder IPC sections 419 (cheating by impersonation) and 420 (inducing property dishonestly) at Cyber Police Station Safdarjung.
According to police, investigation revealed that the total cheated amount of Rs 5,94,664 was credited to three accounts through a payment gateway. One of these accounts, an IndusInd Bank one in the name of one Kunal, a resident of Samta Vihar in Mukundpur, received Rs 1.95 lakh.
“Police reached Kunal’s home, where he said a man named Aditya alias Eddy got this account opened on the pretext of getting him a job. He also provided a mobile number used by Aditya,” said DCP (Southwest) Rohit Meena.
Police found that Aditya lived in Burari. “When we reached his home, he wasn’t there. His location was then traced,” said an officer at the Cyber Police Station.
On June 28, police said a search was conducted at Aditya’s possible hideouts in Burari before he was finally arrested. A mobile phone and two SIM cards were recovered from him.
Police then uncovered an elaborate scam — bank accounts were opened in the names of innocent people, on the pretext of getting them jobs, but were used as a front for scammers indulging infinancial fraud.

He then gave access to the account to some unknown people inWest Bengal, whom he met on a Telegram group. The group was for people who wanted to buy or sell fake bank accounts for financial fraud. Aditya got the addresses of the buyers from the group and sent the bank account kits through courier, police said.
“He (accused) used to create accounts of poor people and job seekers and sold more than 10 accounts to fraudsters in Jamtara, West Bengal and Jharkhand. He was arrested inHyderabadfor a similar crime,” said the officer.The accused also has two previous NCRP complaints against him.

"The government has set up an inter-ministerial committee of various law enforcement and intelligence agencies to tackle the recent “spurt” in transnational organised cybercrimes being launched against Indians from various South East Asian countries such as Cambodia.
Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre’s (I4C) chief executive officer Rajesh Kumar told a press conference here that the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had set up the committee on May 16 and it has held two meetings so far.
The high-powered committee is headed by the special secretary (internal security) in the MHA with officers from Reserve Bank of India, Department of Financial Services, banks, Financial Intelligence Unit, Department of Telecommunication (DoT) and financial technology companies, among others, as its members.
“We have seen a spurt in organised cybercrime being emanating from South East Asian countries that include Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos PDR. The increase is in terms of volume, the number of victims (Indians) affected and the amount of money lost,” Kumar said “We find that 45 per cent of cyber financial frauds taking place in the country are originating from this region,” he said.
The I4C is a wing under the cyber and information security division of the MHA and is mandated to tackle burgeoning cybercrimes and attacks in the country in a coordinated and comprehensive manner.
Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Kumar said that “the quantum of money lost per crime is much higher in cybercrime cases originating from the South East Asian countries and, hence, this high-level committee has been constituted to have a very focused action here.” The I4C is “continuously monitoring and blocking” cybercrime infrastructure likeSkypeaccounts, advertisements onGoogleand Meta, SMS headers, SIM cards, bank accounts, among others, he said.
Kumar said that 3.25 lakh “mule” accounts (bank accounts used for laundering cybercrime funds by using KYC documents of others) have been frozen over the last four months.
More than 3,000 URLs and 595 mobile phone apps have been blocked, 5.3 lakh SIM cards and 80,848 IMEI numbers have been suspended since July last year and 3,401 unlawful content on various social media platforms, website and WhatsApp groups have been taken down over the last two months for “committing” cybercrimes, he said.
This includes 1,500 Skype IDs being taken down too, Kumar said.
“We have seen that the cybercrimes emanating from this (South East Asian) region are being perpetrated by luring people through investment, gaming and dating apps, and fake trading apps etc.,” the officer said.
The total amount reported to have been lost in cybercrimes in the country over the last few months is Rs 7,061.51 crore, out of which “we have been able to put a lien on around 12 per cent, which is about Rs 812.72 crore”, the CEO said.
Kumar said cybercrimes such as “digital arrest” — in which someone impersonates a government official — were also being reported and as many as 4,599 complaints of this fraud were reported to between January-April.
During the same period, 20,043 complaints of trading scam, 62,687 of investment scam and 1,725 of romance or dating scam have been reported in the country.
“This is the abuse of technology…these are basically spoof calls. These calls are being made from abroad by spoofing an Indian number…we are working with the DoT to check this,” Kumar said.
“I would like to inform the general public that they should disconnect such calls and not panic…,” he said.The CEO said in a particular case, a number of Indian youngsters were “lured” in lieu of providing data entry jobs in Cambodia but once they reached there using the services of “fake” domestic agents, they were “compelled” to carry out cybercrimes like investment scams and trading app and dating scams.
TheAndhra PradeshPolice recently arrested three local agents after some Indian nationals employed in a cybercrime “suspected scam compound” in Sihanouk city of Cambodia protested.
The Indian Embassy in Phnom Penh has taken steps for their safety and 360 Indians are being sent back while some 60 people have been arrested by the local police, Kumar said.
The Indian government is in touch with the Cambodian government for repatriating the rest of the Indians stuck there and being forced into cybercrimes, he added.
“We would like to request and appeal to the public that they should not fall for such false and fake recruitment advertisements. Do not fall for easy income schemes that promise your huge returns in a very very short duration,” Kumar said.
“There are some people who are using good knowledge for bad work. The cybercrimes do a grave harm to the country. We at I4C along with other agencies are trying to enhance our capabilities to better tackle these crimes,” the CEO added.
Speaking about the recent spate of bomb threat emails sent to schools, hospitals and airports in various parts of the country, Kumar said these have been sent using VPNs (virtual private network) and investigating agencies were taking help from various countries to trace the culprits.
He also said that they “cannot rule out a Chinese hand” in various cybercrimes that are affecting Indians.

"The Delhi Police have arrested two online fraudsters who allegedly duped a man of Rs 32 lakh on the pretext of making him invest in the stock market, promising huge returns, the police said in a statement on Wednesday.
According to the complaint lodged by the victim, Arvind Sood, a resident of south west Delhi, he ended up losing over Rs 32 lakh through various transactions last October after he fell into the trap of the arrested men – Dharmik Modi, 29, and his accomplice Arunji Thakur, 22.
Police said the two men were part of a large network of investment fraud.
Upon preliminary investigation, the Cyber Crime wing of the police department found that the fraudulent transactions were conducted through UPI, with sums – ranging from Rs 20,000 to Rs 7.6 lakh – routed to different bank accounts.
Explaining the modus operandi, a senior police officer said the fraudsters in a bid to make their victims feel secure in ‘share marketinvestments’, would send back some money as profits. “But if the ‘investors’ express their desire to withdraw the amount, the scammers would convince them to invest more money instead of withdrawing so as to make more profits,” he said.
In Sood’s case, the police said, the conmen convinced him to send them Rs 5 lakh to invest in thestock marketso that he would earn crores of rupees in a short span.
Sood, in his complaint, detailed how he was redirected to various ‘share market brokers’, including the two men. “All of them would make similar promises to Sood about helping him to make a quick buck and increase his wealth. At one point, he also received around Rs 4 lakh as profit, before being redirected to more “experts” who made further offers of attractive returns,” said an officer.
The police traced Dharmik Modi to Gujarat through analysis of call record details and technical surveillance. His arrest and interrogation led to the arrest of Arunji Thakur. During interrogation Modi revealed that he collaborated with his accomplice to receive the funds in exchange for a commission, investigators said.
The police have registered a case for cheating against the two men.

"A 69-YEAR-OLD senior citizen in Pune lost Rs 2 crore in cyber fraud over a period of two weeks recently. “A total of 120 LSD strips have been found in your parcel intercepted by Customs. An FIR has been registered and you will be arrested,” the woman was told by cyber criminals posing as a Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) officer on a video call. The senior citizen was coerced into transferring Rs 2 crore of her life savings through cyber extortion in ‘drugs in parcel fraud.’

In the last week of April, the complainant received a call from a man posing as an executive of an international courier service. He said that a parcel sent by the complainant had been intercepted by the Customs and five passports and 120 strips of LSD have been seized from it. She was told the NCB had registered an FIR against her and she was asked to connect on a video call with him.
Over the next two weeks, large sums of money were sought from the complainant on various false pretexts and by threatening her of legal action including arrest and imprisonment. Officials said she was forced to make close to a dozen large transfers over a period of two weeks, totalling Rs 2.08 crore. “Recently, the complainant came across media reports about drugs in parcel frauds and realised that she had been cheated.

In the drugs in parcel scams, the victims receive the IVR message and are then connected to fake international courier service executives. These executives claim drugs have been found in parcels sent by victims to foreign countries. They are told about police involvement and are told to communicate viaSkypewith fake profiles posing as law enforcement officers. Fraudsters impersonate as IPS officers to further deceive victims. They coerce victims into transferring money for various reasons, including customs fees or legal charges, and by also claiming that their bank accounts are at risk from hackers. Callers often intimidate victims, claiming they’re under surveillance. Both Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad police have reported over 200 cases of drugs in parcel frauds since January last year, officials said.

"The recent act of cyber crime against a large number of schools in the national capital is yet another incident of inimical elements attempting to create a sense of panic and insecurity. Cyber attacks come in different forms, ranging from financial frauds to data breaches to the crippling of critical infrastructure. When viewed at a macro level, the nation cannot afford to withstand such headwinds in our journey to a $5-trillion economy. It is, therefore, imperative that our strategy to counter this threat is clearly enunciated in the first 100 day plans of the new government.
The need for a cyber ministry
The fountainhead of any action is the creation of a framework for governance at the national level to ensure responsibility and accountability for the protection of the national cyberspace. In the present system, while individual ministries are doing well in implementing their respective mandates, the accountability aspect is missing. It may be prudent to recall the cyber attack in the UK in 2003 by a state-backed actor, where during the inquiry, everyone kept passing the buck and no one was found responsible. This is when they decided to create the National Cyber Security Centre under a CEO. It may be a useful exercise for the government to take a stock of some of the recent cyber attacks and examine the flaws in the present system with a view to create an efficient governance structure.
On June 1, 2022, the Australian prime minister announced their first minister for cyber security. There are three main reasons for the creation of such a role. First, cyber security, like internal security and national defence, needs leadership to ensure it remains a constant priority, even when there are more urgent security issues of the day. So having a minister ensures that policy makers/bureaucrats are constantly tasked with the appropriate work. Second, it also helps as the prime minister and his staff do not have the time to work on cyber issues on a daily basis and can therefore depend upon the ministry for any inputs. Third, most of the critical information infrastructure lies in the private sector. A ministry would provide a clear avenue for industry. Without a minister it is difficult to know who has responsibility within the government.
The strategy question
Once the governance structure has been decided, we need to come out with our strategy for protecting national cyberspace. Our present policy of 2013 needs a revision and much work has already been put in by the government on the new strategy, which would promulgate a whole-of-nation approach in addressing the entire ecosystem of cyber security. This strategy needs to be released at the earliest.
While 2023 was a landmark year for the nation with the passage of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act and the Telecom Act, there is a need for a Cyber Security Act to cater for new age crimes after a gap analysis of the existing laws and regulations in view of the cyber crimes.
Growing cases of cyber crime, which involve use of innovative methods of trapping citizens are on the rise. With the increased proliferation of smartphones, many citizens are getting conned. There has been an increase in frauds in the banking and financial services and insurance sectors. Though the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre needs to be complimented for their efforts, the issue needs to be addressed holistically by including the telecom sector, banks, judiciary and the police.
Elections, Deepfakes and disinformation
In this election season we have already witnessed the scourge of deep fakes and disinformation campaigns. Such vectors will continue due to the growing use of social media. Protection of national cyberspace involves a monitoring mechanism and counter action for the same against all violators, big or small.
The proposed national cyber reference framework needs to be made public at the earliest, and also the National Malware Repository, which is an excellent project developed by the DRDO. The use of AI in both cyber defence and offence is on the rise and a coordinated approach to counter it is required. The National Mission on Cyber Physical Systems has done well in creating 25 technology innovations hubs, but now needs to focus on outcomes.
Cyber attacks are borderless and are difficult to attribute, as seen from the Delhi school attacks. Since we are not signatories to the Budapest Convention, we have to depend on Interpol and the coalition of willing nations to rely on threat intelligence and investigation. International cooperation, therefore, is essential in this respect and should form an integral part of our strategy.
Finally, there can be no assured defence in cyberspace without an element of deterrence. The latest cyber strategies of the US, the UK, Australia and others depict a shift from cyber security to cyber power. In addition, the creation of a separate cyber force by PLA is an index of its growing importance. The cyber war is already on at different levels. We need to act fast.

"Let’s celebrate governance that turned one district into a fine example. Offering hope, a way out of cyber crime, innovative solutions ofIAS Faiz Aq Ahmed Mumtazand thedistrict administration of Jamtara, known as a hub of cyber crime, made education a reality for youth.
The following case study is framed from a success story recognised atThe Indian Express Excellence in Governance Awards.UPSC EssentialsofThe Indian Expresstakes you through some inspiring case studies from the area of Governance and Civil Services which not only highlight the problem but also focus on award-winning solutions.
For Essays, Governance and Ethics section of Mains examination as case studies and example-fodder for answers. Candidates will find it useful for framing replies in interviews and personality tests.This particular case study is relevant to questions related to education and youth related social issues.Moreover, such real-life stories should be read, noted, and applied to remain motivated, inspired and also to create role models.
Jharkhand’s Jamtara, a district that is associated with cyber crime also had another problem noticed in its Chengaidih panchayat- most girls in the panchayat were dropping out after middle school. Also, youth who aim to clear competitive exams were clueless about how to work towards their goal. They knew associating themself with a coaching institute and a mentor would help but would require a good amount of money to afford guidance.Can a civil servant script change that touches the lives of youth making education a reality for many, and keeping them away from cyber crime?
How to discourage youth from cyber crime or any crime for that matter? How to make sure that cyber fraud or phishing doesn’t become a household business led by young minds? Well, the most common answer would be to provide them witheducationso that they can get good jobs. What if the education is in shambles? Firstly, the problem of girls and youthdropoutsis grave. One of the reasons among many is that these panchayats do not have enough educational facilities. This decreases the literacy rate in rural areas, especially female literacy.The young school dropouts make the region a popular destination for cyber crime investigations by getting involved in running a cyber fraud hub.
Then, some want to study and achieve their goals like government jobs. The challenge is limited resources like infrastructure, mentorship and guidance. Along with the problem of providing study centers a big task is finding mentors who could hold classes for youngsters appearing for competitive exams.Can good governance bring the district out of cyber crime by engaging the youth and pointing them in the right direction?
While on a field visit to Chengaidih panchayat in Jharkhand’s Jamtara district in 2020, Deputy Commissioner Faiz Aq Ahmed Mumtaz noticed these problems and worked with his team to come up with solutions to address this problem.
— Educational facilities:The administration decided to renovate dilapidated government buildings and convert them into libraries. Each of the 118 panchayats of the district now has libraries managed by the gram sabha. The libraries also double up as study centers, with over 16,000 ‘guidance classes’ being held here since the start of the project in November 2020.
“The concern was real and I immediately thought of doing something about it. I wanted to create a culture of reading and study among the youth. We decided to convert unused government buildings into libraries through the convergence of various schemes. The first library started at Chengaidih panchayat and within eight months, libraries were built in all 118 panchayats of the district,” said Deputy Commissioner.
— Funds and maintenance:The district administration used the 15th Finance Commission’s ‘Untied Funds’ to restore the panchayat buildings, with the cost ranging from Rs 60,000 to Rs 2.2 lakh per library. Bookshelves, tables and chairs were funded by officials at the block and panchayat level or through CSR (corporate social responsibility) funds. The district administration also provided books to the centers.
Each library has a panchayat-level Library Maintenance Committee comprising volunteers, and its own bank account to collect contributions from the public. The onus of purchasing more books, paying electricity bills and upgrading the library is on the local community. All the libraries have been geo-tagged and their coordinates and details have been uploaded on the district website.
— Finding mentors for youngsters appearing for competitive exams:The district administration passed an order asking police personnel, junior engineers, panchayat secretaries and gram rozgar sevaks to hold at least one class every week.
Among those who taught at the Nala centre was police officer Akash Singh, who held classes for three hours a day until two months ago, when he was transferred. Singh taught maths to Class 9 and 10 students and ‘Indian Polity’ to those appearing for competitive exams.
— Innovative ideas, making the best use of available resources and a strong will to bring a change can find solutions and make education a reality for many in a district, known as a hub of cyber crime which now has 118 libraries, all in restored panchayat buildings.
— Talking to Manas Srivastava of The Indian Express, Deputy Commissioner Faiz Aq Ahmed Mumtaz said that he used the‘convergence method’to implement the idea by bringing together government schemes and public-private contributions.
— He had to find solutions to a challenge for getting youth to use the library. “A quiz competition was held among 31 libraries. It gained some traction… we will need sustained efforts to keep all the libraries operational,” said Mumtaz. He toldAbhishek Angad, “It is probably a long shot, but we hope the libraries will help the youth of the district stay away from cyber crime.”
—For scripting change in a district, known as a hub of cyber crime and making education a reality for youth, Faiz Aq Ahmed Mumtaz was awarded The Indian Express Excellence in Governance Award in the Innovative Schemes category.
India’s rural youth can give the country an edge — if good governance can focus on the challenges in education they face and get them the jobs they desire. Discuss.

"Seventy three-year-old Laxmi Road resident Harsha Shah was approached by a friend who wanted to donate some furniture to an orphanage and requested her to look for a good deal. Luckily, around that time she received a message on Facebook messenger from Sujit Kumar, an officer in the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), informing her that he was posted at the Talegaon Dabhade and that he has been transferred abruptly to West Bengal so he would have to get rid of the furniture. He also sent her pictures of that furniture, and bills of the furniture. At the same time, she received a message from the then Pune District Collector’s on the same platform vouching for the Kumar’s character and the quality of the product.
Not surprisingly, by the end of that day, she had lost Rs 15,000. Since she didn’t know how to use online banking, she asked different people to deposit the amounts in the fraudster’s account and pay them in cash. She later learnt that the photos sent to her of the furtniture being loaded in a tempo as well as theFacebookaccount of the collector were fake.
She then went through the usual drill of going to the police station, being turned away and the reluctance to get the complaint registered. She finally manage to get it registered but nothing has moved since.Shah, who is a railway commuter activist of considerable renown, felt that there’s very little hope for any action or recovery in cases of cyber fraud, especially if the amount is not large.
“The situation is so dire. I had to run around so much to file the complaint and I was told, unofficially, that since the amount wasn’t big – although Rs 15,000 is big for me – very little can happen because of the high volume of cases,” said Shah.
When asked if she thinks that the growing number of cybercrimes and the lack of systems to fight them should be an election issue, she said, “Absolutely! Not only have I suffered, but there are many others I know have lost money due to cyber fraud. Also, I haven’t heard any political party talking about this major issue,” she said.
Cyber crimes and financial fraud have seen an exponential increase in recent years. In 2023, the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal (NCCRP) recorded 11.28 lakh complaints such cases.Maharashtrahas the second largest tally with 1,25,153 complaints in 2023, only followed byUttar Pradeshwhich registered 1,97,547 complaints of financial cyber fraud. As per sources inPunePolice, in 2023 Pune city Police received around 22,000 complaints of cyber financial crimes – an average of around 1,500-2,000 per month – of which 10-15 per cent were converted into FIRs.
In addition, economic offences involving investment schemes, ponzi schemes and share trading scams have also been on the high, with each case leading to the cheating of dozens, and even hundreds of individuals. In 2022, 18,729 cases of economic offences were registered in Maharasthra and 1,023 cases in Pune. The data for 2023 is not available yet.
Victims of financial fraud feel the country needs systemic changes to meet the challenge put forth by scams enabled by technology.
Sachin Pawar (39), is one among 270 victims of the Ashtavinayak Investment’s ‘profile investment’ scam. In this scam, victims – most of whom were IT professionals – were lured to take multiple personal loans and then invest the funds in the firm with a promise of 5 % to 10 % returns. The perpetrator of the scam shut the company and absconded in February 2023, leaving all his investors in the lurch.
“We have been following the investigation very closely and I got to know so many loopholes that are in the systems – banking, law enforcement agencies, financial reporting bureaus – that the scamster exploited. They need to be fixed and I can see that no efforts are being taken for that,” said Pawar. After one of the victims of the fraud died by suicide, Pawar and other victims have come together to form a group that will help and guide victims of similar financial fraud.
He said that although the ‘profile investor’ scheme by Ashtavinayak is now exposed as fraud, there are several firms in Pune city itself that run the same scheme and no action is taken against them.
“As a voter I would want the government to take pro-active efforts to safeguard citizens from these frauds and put in systems that can help the victims in real life if someone falls for these scams. Setting up a dedicated agency which has its jurisdiction and expertise in digital technology and tracking, banking, accounting, and communication can be one of the answers to this growing menace,” said Pawar.
Another area of improvement that Pawar feels need to be addressed is the humiliation that victims are put through by investigating agencies.
“What victims of cyber fraud and financial scams need is understanding, support and quick action. What they face, however, is humiliation. ‘How could you have fallen for this!’ is the attitude of the police. We need investigators who understand how these things happen and that anyone can fall for a scam,” said Pawar.

"A captivating Instagram advertisement, coupled with the offer of a ‘trial seed fund’ of Rs 10,000 proved to be the bait that led a Pune woman to fall victim to an online share trading fraud, in which she lost a staggering Rs 3 crore from her life savings. A fraudulent application she was made to log on showed that she had earned profits of Rs 20 crore against her ‘investment’.
AFirst Information Reportin the case was registered at Cyber crime police station ofPunecity last week by the woman, who is a resident of Mohammadwadi area and is in her late 50s. Between the first and last week of March, the woman was manipulated into making 30 transactions to 12 fraudulent bank accounts totalling Rs 3.04 crore, before realising that she was being cheated.
In January this year, the complainant came across an advertisement on Instagram which promised multifold returns. After clicking the link, she was added to a WhatsApp group. A large number of members of the group were discussing how their ‘institutional accounts’ helped them earn huge profits on investments in equity. After reading the messages for close to two months, the complainant was offered a ‘seed amount’ of Rs 10,000 for investment, which was directly transferred to her account. She was then made to download and log on to a phone-based application, which the probe has now revealed was fraudulent.
Over the coming one month, the cyber criminals kept telling her about new investment opportunities in thestock marketand the complainant continued making large transfers. All this while, the phone-based app kept showing over six times her ‘investments’ as profits. In between, she was allowed to make small withdrawals totalling around Rs 1 lakh. After 30 large transfers to 12 bank accounts totalling Rs 3.04 crore, her account on the app reflected profits of Rs 20.66 crore. When she expressed willingness to withdraw all the money, she was told that before withdrawing the money she would have to pay 30 per cent of the total profits as charity and 10 per cent as fees. It was at this point that she realised she was being cheated. She subsequently approached the Cyber crime police station and anFIRwas registered.
In another case registered two weeks ago, aPune-based CA was cheatedof a staggering Rs 3.4 crore in an elaborate share trading by cyber frauds, of which over Rs 2 crore was taken by him as loans from various banks. The cyber criminals used a WhatsApp group named after a British financial major to lure him with high returns on ‘block trade’ and ‘upper circuit trading’.
Over the last five months, the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad police have reported what their cyber investigators are calling an epidemic, a worrying surge in online share trading fraud cases. Fraudsters employ a variety of baits, including trading tips, virtual lectures, mobile applications, and enticing promises of exorbitant returns. SEBI’s advisory on February 26 underscored these tactics, cautioning against fraudsters posing asSEBI-registered entitiesand exploiting social media platforms to peddle fraudulent trading schemes.

"They worked as delivery boys by day but their moonlighting jobs were way more complex. Five men in their twenties, who are now in police custody, together operated a web of 120 bank accounts used by international cyber criminals to receive funds swindled from the victims of online share trading frauds.
In a crackdown against a group of alleged cyber foot soldiers inPune, the probe by the Pimpri Chinchwad police revealed these men not just operated surrogate bank accounts but also facilitated purchase of cryptocurrency to be sent to the pockets of their international masterminds — for a meagre cut.
The cyber cell of the Pimpri Chinchwad police was probing a case of online share trading fraud in which a 46-year-old woman from Pashan Sus Road was cheated of Rs 35 lakh by cyber frauds, who promised her high returns against the investment of her money in stocks.
During the probe, the team from the cyber cell zeroed in on one Junaid Kureshi (21) of Tingare Nagar, who was found to be operating an account which received funds siphoned from the victim.
His probe took police to three more suspects — Salman Shaikh (22), Abdul Ansari (23), and Taufik Shaikh (22), all residents of Lohegaon — who were operating more such bank accounts and also withdrawing large sums from these accounts in cash.
It further came to light that these men were giving the cash to a fifth suspect, identified as Akif Anwar Khan (29) of Kondhwa, who was purchasing Tether cryptocurrency, also referred to as USDT, to be deposited to the digital wallets of the masterminds of the racket believed to be operating from Hong Kong, said an officer who is part of the investigation.
“We have come to know of at least 120 bank accounts which these suspects were operating. These accounts are in the name of people known to them. The holders were being paid small amounts for their accounts to be used for receiving the money siphoned off from victim’s bank accounts,” said the officer.
According to police, Akif used to send details of these accounts to masterminds based in Hong Kong, who in turn were using it to receive funds from the fraud. Junaid, Salman, Abdul and Taufik used to withdraw cash and give it to Akif, who in turn purchased USDT and sent it to the wallets of the masterminds. “Over the last couple of months, these 120 accounts have together seen transactions of close to Rs 15 crores and have been flagged in at least 75 different cyber crime cases.,” said the officer.
Police said the suspects come from weak educational and economic backgrounds and worked as delivery executives for various courier and food delivery services. “These suspects are school and college dropouts and chose to do temporary jobs as delivery boys. We are now probing how they came to be working for the cyber criminals operating from abroad. We believe that operatives who make calls to the victims and do other tasks in these cyber crimes, are Indians, as revealed by the probe from the Ministry of Home Affairs,” said an officer from the cell.
Assistant Inspector Praveen Swami from the cyber cell said, “We have recovered from the suspects multiple debit cards, cheque books of at least 12 banks, multiple cell phones and a cash counting machine, besides Rs 7 lakh cash.”
Sub-inspector Sagar Poman, who is investigating the case, said, “Probe revealed that this group worked as first and second-level operatives for the international cyber masterminds, and received up to five per cent cut of the total transactions that were made through these surrogate accounts. Our probe will continue against such operatives and the higher-ups in the hierarchy.”
The probe was conducted under the supervision of DCP (crime) Sandeep Doiphode, ACP Vishal Hire and senior inspector Santosh Patil.
In what cyber investigators are calling an epidemic in online share trading fraud cases registered with Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad police, online criminals are using baits such as trading tips, online lectures, phone-based apps and promises of very high returns to lure victims.
On February 26, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) issued an advisory in this regard highlighting the tactics of fraudsters, including posing as SEBI–registered entities and exploiting social media to promote fraudulent trading schemes.

"Amid threats of his identity being stolen and being misused in drug trafficking and money laundering, a Pune-based doctor went through a harrowing week-long ordeal. The doctor was asked to isolate himself in a hotel, was made to stay on audio calls continuously for ‘surveillance’ and was manipulated into liquidating investments to transfer the money to ‘government safe accounts’ as he ended up losing over Rs one crore to the cyber criminals.
AnFIRin the case has been registered at Cyber police station by the senior medical practitioner inPune, who is in his early 50s. Officials said that while the modus operandi for the cyber fraud mirrored that of a ‘drugs in parcel’ scam, the relentless pressure from the perpetrators compounded the severity of the situation for the victim. Over the span of six days in the first week of March, the doctor found himself entangled in a web of deceit and extortion masterminded by cyber criminals.
Earlier this month, the complainant received a call from a man claiming to be a courier executive, saying that a parcel sent by him toTaiwanhad been intercepted in which five passports and 200 grams MDMA drugs had been recovered. As he insisted he never sent any parcel, he was told that his identity was being misused for drug trafficking and money laundering. He was asked to immediately go toMumbaiCrime Branch to register FIR or register it through aSkypevideo call. He then received multiple Skype calls from a profile with a logo of Mumbai Crime Branch and persons wearing police uniforms and using names of actual serving IAS and IPS officers including a serving police commissioner inMaharashtraand former governor of the RBI.
These persons asked for the victim’s Aadhar card and told him that an FIR had been registered in his name and was shown a paper with the fake letterhead of the Central Bureau of Investigation. The suspects claiming to be officers then forced the victim into providing details of his financials including bank accounts, savings, investments etc. At this point the victim was told that he will have to isolate himself in a hotel. He did as instructed and booked a hotel room and was told that he was under surveillance and was made to keep an audio call on constantly. He was told that till the time verification of his account was done, he would have to transfer over Rs 15 lakh from his account to a ‘government account’ — which were fraudulent accounts of the cyber criminals. After the transfer, he was subsequently manipulated into liquidating his investments and savings and was made to transfer over Rs 85 lakh again to those fraud accounts. After these transfers, he was sent letters with fake letterheads of the RBI stating that the funds had been received.
At this point, he was asked to send the photo of his family for ‘security purposes’ and was asked to make more transfers to ensure that his family members are not prosecuted. It was at this point that he realised that he had been cheated in an elaborate cyber fraud and approached the cyber police station. “We have launched a probe into the case and are working on the details obtained from the bank accounts used by the Cyber criminals,” said an officer from Cyber police station.

"Karnataka DGP Alok Mohan said on Thursday that the number of cybercrime cases registered by the police had doubled in the past three years, posing a major challenge for the law enforcement agencies and the information technology industry in the state.
“TheKarnatakastate police registered 11,000 cybercrime cases in 2020. The number has doubled to nearly 22,000 in 2023. The doubling of the crime figures in the period of just three years is a huge challenge for the Karnataka state police as well as the IT industry,” Mohan said at the Cyber Crimes Conclave in Bengaluru.
Mohan also stated that one in four crimes committed in Bengaluru were cybercrimes. “In Bengaluru almost 25 per cent of the crimes being reported as of now are cybercrimes,” he said.
The police chief said that 64,000 complaints had been lodged in the past nine months with the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal and that the state police had returned Rs 70 crore to cyber fraud victims.
Mohan also called for a collaborative approach with the IT industry, academia and other stakeholders to fight cyber crime unitedly. Karnataka is the first state to have experimented with this approach with a partnership between the Infosys Foundation, the Karnataka CID and the Data Security Council of India to set up the Centre for Cybercrime Investigation Training & Research in Bengaluru. The centre had trained more than 31,000 police officers, judicial officers and prosecutors in the last four years, he said.
Mohan also said the police were planning to enhance their cyber forensic capabilities and capability building in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
Participating in a panel discussion titled Cyber Crime Challenges in Karnataka, DIG Vamsi Krishna (economic offence, CID) said the number of cybercrimes reported in the past two years in the state had increased by 183 per cent and that the crimes had become more complicated.
“Post the pandemic, things have got more complicated. We are seeing the moduses changing, technologies evolving, and ransomware and malware becoming more complicated in cybercrime. Recently we came across polymorphic malware, which is AI-driven and will replicate itself in a different fashion and you will not be able to catch it,” he said.

"A Ghaziabad woman has been allegedly duped of around Rs. 40 lakh by cyber criminals on the pretext of ‘investment’ and a work-from-home job offer.
Narrating her ordeal, complainant Swati Chauhan (28), a resident of Dream Homes in Wave City, said she received a WhatsApp message regarding a job last year. “On November 9, 2023, I received a WhatsApp message wherein a woman introduced herself as Roshni, from Laqshya Media Group. She asked me to join a group on another messaging app — Telegram, where I would be assigned certain tasks and would be paid on completing it. Initially, they transferred Rs 150, 300, 500, 2,800 into my account through UPI,” Chauhan said in her complaint to the police.
The woman further said, “They told me about some prepaid tasks, in which first I had to transfer money to them. I was asked to follow some steps on their website following which they would return me the money along with the profit. I followed all the instructions. Later they said there was something wrong with my data and asked me to transfer money again. I was told they would have to open a separate account as it was not possible to withdraw money and I was asked to send money again.”
Chauhan said that in this way she sent around Rs 40 lakh to the scamsters and each time in different accounts. “Lastly, the accused told me that in order to withdraw my amount, they would have to increase my score and again asked me to transfer another Rs 20 lakh, promising to return all my money after this. I became suspicious about it and informed about the incident at home.”
AnFIRunder IPC section 420 (cheating) and section 66D of the Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008, has been registered in Wave City police station. Officials said that the matter is under investigation and attempts are on to nab the accused.

"The probe by Pune police’s Cyber crime investigators following the arrest of two money mules in a recent case of ‘drugs in parcel’ fraud revealed that large sums of money was swindled from the victims, ultimately landing with the top tier cyber criminals operating from China, Dubai and Taiwan through the cryptocurrency route.
The Cyber Police station ofPuneCity police is currently investigating a series of cases commonly referred to as ‘drugs in parcel’ in which till now, over two dozen people have lost close to Rs 4 crore in total.
In such cases, the cyber criminals initially pose as executives of an international courier company and later as senior police officers – at times, even misusing the names of serving IPS officers and investigation agencies like the cyber crime cell, anti-narcotics cell, CBI, Enforcement Directorate (ED), Customs and in some cases, the Reserve Bank of India.
Officers said the “drugs in parcel” frauds are being reported from across India with many cases being probed by police in Delhi,Mumbai, Kerala,Andhra Pradeshand Bengaluru, along with Pune. In one of the largest such scams, a Delhi-based doctor was cheated for Rs 4.5 crore using the name of an IPS officer from Mumbai.
A team from the Cyber crime police station of Pune City recently got a breakthrough in one of cases they are investigating in which a woman lost Rs 3lakh in June to cyber criminals who told her a parcel was sent in her name toTaiwanand 140 grams of Mephedrone was found in it. Names of two serving IPS officers fromMaharashtracadre were misused by cyber criminals who threatened her of legal action if she did not pay the money. The cyber criminals also posed as CBI officers to threaten the complainant woman, who works as a business analyst with a Pune based private firm.
During the investigation of this particular case, the team led by Senior Inspector Minal Supe Patil recently arrested two money mules — suspects who provided and operated fraudulent bank accounts which were used by the Cyber criminals to receive the transfer from the woman complainant. The first alleged money mule identified as Naresh Jain alias Sureshbhai Desai was arrested from Saswad area of Pune close to three weeks ago. Based on the leads obtained from him, another money mule Azhar Atikh Khan was arrested from Delhi on December 8.
Speaking toThe Indian Express, Senior Inspector Supe Patil said, “Our investigation has revealed that while the network of fraudulent bank accounts is operated by money mules based in India, these scams are masterminded and executed by top tier cyber criminals based outside India. After these funds are received in the first chain of fraudulent accounts, they are moved around in multiple accounts to make them difficult to trace, before ultimately being used to buy cryptocurrency which lands outside India. Our probe suggests that these funds ultimately land with top tier cyber criminals who are based in China, Dubai and Taiwan. The complex money trail, multiple fraud accounts used for juggling the money and money finally landing abroad, make these investigations a challenge. Such money trail is also observed in the cases of task frauds.”
The cases of ‘drugs in parcel’ scams begin with the victims getting a call from people posing as executives of international courier services. They tell the victims that a parcel has been sent in their name to places like Dubai or Taiwan. In none of these cases victims had sent any parcels to anyone nor were they expecting any parcel. The victims are then told that drugs — like MDMA or Mephedrone along with multiple passports of the same person and unaccounted foreign currency have been detected in their parcels and that their case is being referred to by the police. According to investigators, in the cases that Pune police have probed, the Cyber criminals have said the victim’s cases were being referred to Mumbai Cyber crime cell or Mumbai narcotics cell and then to the ED, CBI or Customs.
The cyber criminals then ask victims to come to aSkypechat and communicate with a profile that has the image with an emblem of police or other investigating agency.
The fraudsters talk to victims using names of IPS officers actually serving with Maharashtra police and other agencies and make the victims transfer funds on various pretexts. Investigation has revealed criminals have used the name of IPS officers who have served in the area of Cyber crime and narcotics, so when the victims search the names, they do find references online, making them further believe the lie, investigators have said.
In these cases, the investigator said, the fraudsters ask money on varied pretexts. “In some other cases, they say that charges like customs clearance, legal fees are to be paid and threaten to arrest them if these fees are not paid. And in some cases they say that the bank accounts of the victims are vulnerable to attack by hackers and all the funds should be transferred to a ‘safe account’ provided by the fraudsters. In these cases callers say victims are under surveillance and their phone calls are being traced,” an officer said.

"The cybercrime police in Bengaluru have arrested a 25-year-old man who allegedly kept more than 13,000 nude photos of several women, including his girlfriend and other colleagues.
A police officer said they took action against the accused, Aditya Santosh, a resident of Bengaluru, after a lawyer of the firm he works for filed a complaint on November 23.
According to the police, the accused had been in a relationship with a 22-year-old woman colleague for the last four months. He allegedly recorded some of their private moments on his phone.
She took his phone without knowledge to delete these photos and opened the gallery, said the police. She was shocked to find the nude photos, including those of her colleagues, and most of them appeared morphed. The woman approached the office staff and informed them about it.
An employee of the officer toldThe Indian Express, “We do not know his intentions but it would put the women in trauma and we complained to the police to investigate the matter.”
Santosh has worked as a customer service agent in the same office for the last five months, the police said. A police officer said a primary probe revealed that he was storing and morphing photos for his own pleasure, but they were checking if he circulated these photos or blackmailed any women using them.
The police booked the accused under Information Technology Act sections 67 (publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form), 67 (a) (publishing or transmitting of material containing sexually explicit act).

"A senior citizen in Bengaluru has been defrauded of Rs 1.52 crore in the widespread courier scam wherein perpetrators make phone calls claiming to be police officials who have intercepted parcels with contraband material. As part of their modus operandi, the fraudsters ask the victims to transfer large amounts of funds to be cleared of drug trafficking and money laundering charges.
According to a complaint registered with the South CEN police station by senior citizen Debashish Das, 66, he received a call on November 10 from a person who identified himself as FedEx courier firm worker Kartikeya. The ‘courier firm worker’ claimed that a case had been registered against Das inMumbaiover a courier sent in his name toTaiwanwith five expired passports, six credit cards, and 950 gram of the illegal MDMA drug.
Das was told that a police case had been registered with the Andheri cybercrime police station in Mumbai and he was asked to get in touch with an Andheri police officer on aSkypecall.
When the senior citizen downloaded Skype and used a link that he was sent, a man identifying himself as Mumbai cybercrime branch police officer ‘Pradeep Sawant’ was on the other end of the video call.
The senior citizen was told that some persons had opened fake bank accounts in his name for money laundering and that to obtain clearance from money laundering charges he would have to send the details of all his bank accounts to a deputy commissioner of police.
A person pretending to be a DCP then told Das to close all his fixed deposit and savings accounts and to transfer the funds in these accounts to a bank account designated by the ‘DCP’.
Trusting the person who pretended to be a DCP, the 66-year-old man transferred Rs 1.52 crore through RTGS from his State Bank of India account to a Punjab National Bank account. The fraudsters who claimed that they would send back the money within 30 to 40 minutes after verifying whether money laundering was involved did not respond once the money was transferred, the victim has alleged.
The senior citizen is the latest victim of widespread fraud wherein the identities of law enforcement agencies like the Mumbai police, the NCRB, and the CBI are being used to cheat the gullible.
In June this year, a software engineer and his wife, a faculty at the Indian Institute of Management, Bengaluru, fell prey to a cyber fraud featuring fake policemen and a fake courier service. The software engineer reported the loss of Rs 33.24 lakh while the IIMB faculty member reported the loss of Rs 1.73 lakh.
The software engineer, 39, filed a complaint on June 29 with the Bengaluru police stating that he received calls from a person claiming to be with the FedEx courier service to state that a parcel sent in his name to Taiwan had been seized by the Mumbai police for containing illegal items. The phone call was subsequently transferred to a person impersonating a Mumbai deputy commissioner of police who claimed that a money laundering case had been registered against the techie.
The techie was asked to join a Skype call with the ‘DCP’ and was told to transfer funds to various accounts with hisAadhaarnumber and photos in order to verify his credentials. The ‘DCP’ who threatened dire consequences claimed that the money deposited in various accounts would be transferred back to the techie after verifications. A total amount of Rs 33,24,859 was transferred.
In the wake of a deluge of cybercrimes being reported in Bengaluru, the city police have decided to categorise cybercrimes under four specific groups with four officers of the rank of deputy commissioner of police designated to supervise the crimes in each category.
As many as 250 cases involving fake courier fraud have been reported in Bengaluru this year. The Bengaluru police announced last week that the investigation of these cases along with three other types of common cyber fraud – Aadhaar Enabled Payment Services fraud (116 cases), WhatsApp sextortion (115 cases), and online job fraud (4,607 cases) – would be prioritised for investigations.
The DCP North-East will head the team investigating the AEPS frauds, the DCP Traffic East will head the team probing the FedEx courier frauds, the DCP Traffic North will supervise the probes into cases of sextortion and the DCP Traffic South will supervise investigations of online job frauds, the Bengaluru police commissioner said Friday.
“The designated DCPs must ensure that the cybercrimes in their supervision are probed properly and must coordinate with the nodal officers in banks and the central government’s Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) to find cyber criminals and recover funds lost by victims,” Bengaluru Police Commissioner B Dayananda said.

"In the wake of an avalanche of cybercrimes being reported in Bengaluru, the city police have decided to categorise the cases under four specific groups with four officers of the rank of deputy commissioner of police designated to supervise each category.
The move to create special investigation teams for the different categories of cybercrimes comes in the wake of new patterns emerging every few months, with the latest beingAadhaar-enabled Payment System (AePS) frauds. As many as 116 such cases have been registered in Bengaluru where the victims have found that their Aadhaar credentials have been used without their knowledge to debit funds from their bank accounts.
Another common category of cybercrime being reported in the city is courier fraud or Fedex fraud (250 cases) where victims are led to believe that they have been sent a suspicious parcel and are forced to pay huge amounts to avoid police hassle or legal proceedings.
The other common forms of cybercrime are sextortion (115 cases) and online job fraud cases (4,607 cases).
“In recent times, a number of cybercrimes, particularly the Aadhaar Enabled Payment System frauds, the Fedex courier frauds, WhatsApp sextortion videos and online job frauds, are being reported and it has been decided to prioritise the investigation of these cases. Four DCP rank officers will head four special teams to probe these cases,” Bengaluru Police Commissioner B Dayananda said Friday.
DCP North-East will head the team investigating the AEPS frauds, DCP Traffic East will head the team to probe the Fedex courier frauds, DCP Traffic North will supervise the probes into cases of sextortion and DCP Traffic South will supervise a team investigation online job frauds, the police commissioner said.
“The designated DCPs must ensure that the cybercrimes in their supervision are probed properly and coordinate with the nodal officers in the banks and the central government’s Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) to hunt down cyber criminals and recover funds lost by victims,” Dayananda said.
In Bengaluru, 10,555 cybercrime cases were registered in 2019 and the police managed to solve 2,059 of them (19 per cent). In 2020, 8,892 cybercrime cases were registered of which 3,001 were solved (30 per cent). In 2021, 6,423 cases were registered and 1,902 cases were solved (29 per cent) and in 2022, over 10,000 cases were registered but the police are yet to disclose how many were solved.
Cybercrimes make up 80 per cent of all cases in the city. So, here’s a quick look at the four categories of cybercrimes in Bengaluru.
Aadhaar-enabled Payment Services cases in Bengaluru
In late October, the Bengaluru police arrested two persons from Bihar who were involved in fraudulent withdrawal of money using Aadhaar-enabled Payment System (AePS).
The Bengaluru North East Cyber Crime, Economic Offences and Narcotics Police arrested the two persons in connection with two cases of fraud. Complainants had alleged that money was withdrawn from their accounts without their knowledge.
According to the police, the accused downloaded property documents from the Kaveri portal — a web-based application of the Department of Stamps and Registration of theKarnatakagovernment. From these documents, the accused receivedAadhaar carddetails and forged the fingerprints of the victims to withdraw money using AePS.
Over the past six months, several people who had registered their properties had filed complaints that money was withdrawn from their accounts, days or in some cases, weeks after the registration.
Fedex courier scam
A cyber fraud involving fake policemen, who impersonate officers of the CBI, narcotics bureau and the anti terrorism squad of theMaharashtraPolice to target gullible people, make their victims believe that they are trapped in a web of crime involving fake parcels (containing drugs or accessories of terror crimes). This has led to the cheating of several lakhs of rupees from people in Bengaluru.
The courier scam (on account of the fraud involving claims of the presence of a Fedex or other parcels), which has been around for a while, has been traced to gangs operating out of remote locations in India.
On June 23, 2023, a PhD student at the Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru filed a police complaint over the loss of Rs 1,34,650 to the courier scam. The 30-year-old received a call from a person impersonating a Fedex employee who said a package had arrived in her name containing illegal items and that a case of identity theft had occurred.
“They impersonated aMumbaiNarcotics Division officer and threatened me of filing a case for illegally supplying MDMA. Extremely scared and panicked, I transferred the money. I kindly request you to take legal action and freeze the transactions,” she told the Bengaluru central division police in her complaint.
Nithin Kamath, the founder and CEO of the Bengaluru-headquartered financial services firm Zerodha, also reported on social media on June 23, 2023, the prevalence of the courier scam.
“There’s a new scam in the name of FedEx, Blue Dart, and other courier companies that you need to be aware of. A colleague got a call from a person claiming to be from FedEx saying that a parcel had been confiscated by the police because drugs were found in it,” Kamath said on his social media account.
Sextortion
In 2021, the death of a 26-year-old MBA graduate who was a victim of an online blackmail and extortion racket put the spotlight on the menace of “sextortion” by organised gangs using social media accounts of their victims.
The “sextortion” case that led to the alleged suicide of the MBA graduate is among a series of cases across the country involving organised gangs that are targeting people through their social media accounts.
The probe into the suicide case and a CID cybercrime probe into a sextortion case of a businessman in 2021 led the police to four persons from the Bharatpur region ofRajasthanwho were allegedly operating a full fledged online extortion racket using fake identities.
Online job fraud
In October this year, a software professional in Bengaluru reported the loss of over Rs 50 lakh in an online job cum investment scam.
The techie, Darshan S, has reported the loss of Rs 50.53 lakh in a case filed with the Bengaluru cybercrime police where he stated that he was lured into carrying out tasks and was offered huge returns on payments. He has alleged that he was lulled into believing the scheme after seeing returns in his account on initial investments.
An investigation into a similar case earlier this year by the cybercrime police revealed a network of 84 bank accounts through which fraudulently acquired funds moved. The probe revealed that as much as Rs 854 crore moved through these bank accounts.
When the police looked for the bank accounts linked to the cybercrime in Bengaluru on the National Cyber Crime Portal (which is linked to the 1930 cyber national helpline), they found there were 5,013 cases across India where the same set of bank accounts had been used by cyber criminals to funnel funds swindled from victims.
A similar case had unravelled inHyderabadin July this year where the Hyderabad cybercrime police revealed that 15,000 victims were cheated of Rs 712 crore through 113 bank accounts created for fake companies as a part of a fraud by a group of local operatives found to be linked to Dubai-based operators having China links.

"The Bengaluru police cyber crime unit has busted an interstate cyber fraud network which had opened several benami accounts (mule accounts) to carry out cyber frauds. The police have arrested six accused of which, five are from Kerala and one hails from Karnataka.
The group used to trap innocent people, especially petty workers in the service sectors, and obtain their KYC documents by promising financial rewards.
According to Bengaluru police commissioner B Dayananda, the group used to create mule accounts in different banks in the name of the victims and provide them to cyber fraudsters.
As a result, the money collected by cheating innocent people would get transferred through these bank accounts and converted into cash and delivered to the fraudsters. “Of the six accused, one also visited Dubai to get trained and learn the technique of financial crime,” said Dayananda.
During the investigation, 126 bank accounts opened by the accused in the name of innocent people were unearthed and a total of 75 cyber fraud cases across India, including Bengaluru, came to light. Out of the 75 cases, 20 are connected to Bengaluru.
Dayananda also stated that cyber fraud cases involving misuse ofAadhaarcards are more common with over 116 cases being identified so far. It is followed by FedEx courier fraud cases, online job fraud cases and cases of sextortion.
Cricket betting racket busted
In another case, the Central Crime Branch (CCB) of Bengaluru busted a cricket betting racket and arrested a master bookie, Dayananda said. The accused was identified as Prakash Shetty.
According to the police commissioner, CCB officers from the Special Enquiry wing received information that one person, in the Shankarapura police station limits, was indulging in cricket betting. He had obtained the User ID and password of allexch.bet from the master bookie and had given it to his accomplices, an officer said.
Subsequently, Shetty was arrested and Rs 1.5 lakh in cash and one mobile phone were seized from his possession. A case was registered at the Shankarapura police station.
The CCB officers, who took over the probe, found during Shetty’s questioning that he was training four people from other states at a house in Udupi under the Ajjarkad police station limits.
The police said Shetty trained his accomplices about allexch.bet and other online betting apps and had created a WhatsApp group called ‘Team Developer’.
On November 16, the CCB raided the house in Udupi where Shetty coached the others and seized six mobile phones and one tablet device. They also froze Rs 41,71,000 in three bank accounts used for the crime, the officers said, adding that further investigation is on.
Gold ornaments and jewellery recovered
In yet another case, the Bengaluru police arrested twoRajasthan-based individuals for robbing a jewellery shop in Nagarathpet. According to the police, the accused worked at the shop as employees.
A group of three members, who were employees of the shop, robbed antique gold and silver items from the shop and a complaint in this regard was filed by the owner at the Halasuru Gate police station on October 29.
During the investigation, two of the accused were arrested and 1.6 kg gold worth Rs 1.2 crore, 6.4 kg silver worth Rs 5.5 lakh, old currency notes, wrist watches and a two-wheeler were seized. A manhunt for the third accused is on, the police said.

"ON JULY 1 this year, when Thane resident Ali Nawaz received a phone call about his electricity bill payment pending, he was confused as he had already made the payment. However, since the caller said that his electricity supply would be disconnected, he tried making the payment and lost Rs 4,500. That is when he realised he had been duped.
A friend advised the distraught Nawaz to call cyber crime helpline number 1930 that promised to recover money if called during the golden hour – within one hour of the crime. He quickly dialled the number but the call did not get through. He dialled multiple times — the line got cut or no one answered, following which he gave up.
Nawaz then tried the cyber crime website cybercrime.gov.in but gave up after he found the process too complicated, immediately after the harrowing experience. A few days later he tried to file an online complaint again and it took him two days to successfully register a complaint.
Nawaz then received a message with a mobile number of a personnel from the local police station who would contact him. The person, however, never called or even answered the call. A few days later, much to his bewilderment, he received an email from the portal that his query had been resolved.

Priya (name changed) had a similar experience and lost Rs 1,300 while making an online order. When she called theMumbaiPolice helpline number, she was asked to call 1930. However, she could not get through even after multiple attempts. She then tried the cyber crime website and gave up after finding the process too cumbersome.
In order to find out if these were isolated incidents,The Indian Expresscalled up the helpline number at least 15 times between August, September and October, but got through only twice. Many of the instances, there was an automated response following which the line was cut with the message “line busy”.
This has been the story of several Mumbaikars who had called up 1930 — a country wide cyber-crime helpline number, after being victims of frauds. Mumbai, considered the financial capital of the country, is plagued by cyber crimes with lakhs of rupees estimated to be lost daily to fraudsters calling from various parts of the state.
Ironically, the pilot project of the dedicated national cyber helpline number 1930, developed by the ICCC (Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre), was carried out in Mumbai in June 2022. After the pilot was successful, it was replicated in other parts of the country.
InMaharashtra, the 1930 helpline is divided into calls coming to Mumbai and those to the rest of Maharashtra.
Earlier this year, the Maharashtra Cyber — the nodal body for cyber crimes in the state — took over the 1930 calls that came to Mumbai as well. Upset, senior officers of the Mumbai police then raised the issue with ICCC and in June, the Mumbai Police was again given the control of 1930 for calls to Mumbai.
Deputy Commissioner of Police DS Swamy, holding additional charge of cyber crime, overseeing the 1930 Mumbai helpline, said that in September, they received 262 calls per day on an average and blocked fraudulently transferred amounts of Rs 6.17 lakh every day.
Another senior officer said that in June this year, after the helpline was brought back to Mumbai Police from Maharashtra Cyber, there were some technical glitches for some time, due to which calls were not answered.
On callers not being able to get through, the officer said that till recently they had six to eight persons taking calls in one shift that was increased to 11persons to take calls from across the city. However, due a technical glitch calls from Navi Mumbai, Thane, Virar and nearby places, were flooding the helpline. As per the data provided by the Mumbai Police, of the 8,486 calls they received in September, 2,914 were from outside Mumbai.
“Till recently, we had around six to eight persons on shift taking calls that will soon be augmented to 11 per shift.
When we have enough people to take calls, people will be able to get through easily. At present, we are able to respond to at least one-third of the calls we receive with cyber complaints,” the officer added.
Another officer said that they are soon going to take up the issue of proper geo fencing so that the Mumbai helpline number does not receive calls from Thane, Navi Mumbai, Mira Bhayandar and other places around Mumbai that should go to the Maharashtra Cyber helpline.
An officer from Maharashtra cyber police that handles calls from the rest of Maharashtra said that they have 23 phone lines who have received 2,200 calls per day in the month of September and blocked Rs 33 lakh every day.
An officer from Maharashtra Cyber that caters to the rest of the state said that they receive 66,594 calls — nearly 2,200 calls per day — registered 6,670 complaints — 222 complaints per day — and recovered Rs 9.92 crore — Rs 33 lakh per day — in September.
The Maharashtra Cyber officer conceded that they have their own share of problems. They have 23 lines and have struggled to get manpower to take those calls. Initially, the cyber police used employees from Maharashtra State Security Corporation (MSSC). They left after the cyber police did not pay remuneration in time.
At present, the cyber police use home guards to take calls. A source said, “It is difficult to manage with them too as since it is a voluntary force, not everyone shows up every day.”
The officer, however, said that all these issues will be taken care of once the Maharashtra Cyber project, for which the state government has approved a whopping Rs 837 crore last month, becomes functional. A five-storey property with an area of one lakh square feet in Navi Mumbai has been taken by the government for the purpose. On one of the floors, there will be a 100-member strong call centre to take calls from across the state.
The officer said, “We are hoping the cyber project will become operational in a few months. Once that happens, the cyber police will have a better approach to calls made by cyber victims from across the state.”
The officer, however, said that it was not yet decided if calls from Mumbai will also be taken by this call centre or it will remain with the Mumbai Police Commissionerate.
However, with lakhs of rupees estimated to be lost daily in the financial capital that sees an ever-increasing number of cyber crimes, even a delay of a few months could prove costly.
When asked about the difficulty faced by citizens to register complaints on cyber crime portal, a nodal officer from Maharashtra said, “The portal caters to the entire country and hence needs as many details and faces high traffic.
However, the team is working on it and it will soon be made much more accessible.”

Nine people have been arrested in the Porsche accident case, including the 17-year-old driver whose blood sample was swapped with his mother's at Sassoon Hospital. A chargesheet has been filed and bail applications submitted, with evidence showing the driver was drunk. Pr",Customer Care Fraud,Medium
"A 61-year-old IT services businessman from Pune was cheated to the tune of Rs 18 lakh by cyber criminals who posed as courier company executives and officers from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the police said. The accused allegedly told him that drugs had been found in a parcel ‘sent’ by him to Taiwan and extorted money from him on the pretext of avoiding legal action, including arrest.
This is yet another case in the series of cases being referred to as ‘drugs in parcel’ scams being investigated by thePuneand Pimpri Chinchwad police in which over 18 people have lost close to Rs 3 crore in total. In such cases, the cyber criminals initially pose as executives of an international courier company and later as senior police officers – at times, even misusing the names of serving IPS officers and investigation agencies like the cyber crime cell, anti-narcotics cell, CBI, Enforcement Directorate (ED), Customs and in some cases, the RBI.
In the latest case registered at the cyber crime police station of Pune city last week, the 61-year-old resident of Pashan who owns an IT services business was swindled of Rs 18.1 lakh within less than three hours on September 18.
On the morning of September 18, the complainant said he received a call on his cell phone from people posing as executives of an international courier service. He was allegedly told that a parcel had been sent in his name to one Hang Lin inTaiwanand that it contained 150 mg of ‘MD’ drug – which is generally an acronym used for MDMA or ecstasy – along with eight credit cards and three pen drives. The complainant said he told the caller that he had not sent any such parcel and expressed concern that his identity was being misused.
The man, posing as a courier company executive, then allegedly asked him to make an online call to an address which he claimed was the ‘cyber crime cell ofMumbai’. The person who picked up the call at this address identified himself as an IPS officer, using the name of an officer who has served in Mumbai in the past. He allegedly told the complainant that his name had appeared in a money laundering investigation in which 28 bank managers had been arrested recently. This accused then referred to an online calling address with a profile image of the CBI. This time, the people at the other end of the call allegedly identified themselves as a CBI officer and another from the “financial action task force” of the RBI. They said that his account was being monitored by the RBI, the complainant informed the police.
The accused allegedly asked him to transfer half the amount from his bank account to the “RBI bank account” for verification, saying that these funds would be transferred back to him in 15 minutes. The complainant, fearing legal action and possible arrest, made three transfers totalling Rs 18.1 lakh to a fraudulent account as instructed by the callers. When the callers started asking for more money for further verification, he realised that he had been cheated and approached the cyber crime police station.
Officials from the cyber crime police station of Pune city said that they have launched a probe into the bank accounts and online calling addresses used by the cybercriminals.
Officers said that ‘drugs in parcel’ scams are being reported from across India with many cases being probed by police in Delhi, Mumbai, Kerala,Andhra Pradeshand Bengaluru, apart from Pune. In one of the largest such scams, a Delhi-based doctor was cheated of Rs 4.5 crore using the name of an IPS officer from Mumbai.

"A software professional in Bengaluru has reported the loss of over Rs 50 lakh in an online investment scam that is on the same lines as hundreds of cases reported on the National Cyber Crime Portal in recent months.
As per the case filed with the Bengaluru cyber crime police, Darshan S was allegedly cheated of Rs 50.53 lakh after being lured into carrying out tasks. He was also offered huge returns on the payments. The techie alleged that he was led to believe the accused after seeing returns in his account on initial investments.
Darshan said he was contacted on messaging platforms Whatsapp and Telegram by a phone number from a foreign location and offered huge returns on investments to carry out tasks assigned by unidentified operators.
He initially invested small amounts and earned returns and was convinced that the scheme was genuine. The scam operators then asked him to invest higher amounts up to Rs 10 lakh and was told that he would get all his money back with a huge interest on completion of all tasks assigned to him.
“After getting the victim to deposit over Rs 50 lakh of funds in various accounts the scam operators stopped responding to the demands to return his money,” a police official said. The scam is alleged to have occurred between September 26 and October 15 with the suspects identified as a woman going by the name of Emma and a private advertising firm.
“The modus operandi in the case is the same as what we have seen in several cases in recent days and a case that we have tracked to find local operatives,” a police official said.
An investigation into a police complaint of cheating to the tune of Rs 8.5 lakh filed by a 26-year-old woman who was lured – on an app initially and later on a WhatsApp group – to make small investments for high returns and was eventually cheated, led the cyber crime police in September to a local gang operating from Bengaluru in cahoots with international operators.
Investigations by the cyber crime police surrounding the network in Bengaluru – through 84 bank accounts to which the fraudulently acquired funds were transferred – revealed that as much as Rs 854 crore had moved rapidly through these bank accounts in the last two years.
By the time the cyber crime police traced these accounts and froze them in September, to prevent their usage in more frauds, only Rs 5 crore remained in them. The investigators then looked for bank accounts linked to the cyber crime in Bengaluru on the National Cyber Crime Portal (linked to the 1930 national cyber helpline) they found 5,013 cases across India where the same set of bank accounts had been used by cyber criminals to funnel funds swindled from victims.
A similar case had unravelled inHyderabadin July this year where the cyber crime police revealed that 15,000 victims had been cheated of Rs 712 crore through 113 bank accounts created for fake companies as part of the fraud by a group of local operatives found to be linked to Dubai-based operators having China links.

"In a shocking turn of events, an app, which defrauded many in the region, suddenly vanished, leaving victims reeling from losses. As investigators delve into this elaborate scheme, the modus operandi of these scammers is coming to light. As complaints flood in from multiple states, the question remains: how did the scammers orchestrate this grand vanishing act?
On its final day of operation, investors in one of the WhatsApp groups managed by the ‘Foxccon app’ handlers apparently received a message in Japanese language, which, when translated stating, “Good evening. I am in Japan. Thanks to all for the full payments. I will remember all of you. We will open a new platform for cheating you. Bye” when one of the investors, Vijay Kumar, put the message inGoogletranslation to get its sense. The mobile application was launched last year and ceased operations on October 10.
Kumar, who, along with six family members, incurred a collective loss of around Rs 2.72 lakh, toldThe Indian Expressthat he was introduced to the app via a friend Bheem Singh. “Initially, I received a refund of my initial investment, which led me to encourage my wife and other relatives to invest.
My brother-in-law, sister-in-law, and two friends also started investing and received returns on their initial investments. However, when our investments exceeded Rs 50,000 each, the app stopped responding, and we suffered a total loss of Rs 2.72 lakh,” he added.
Kumar explained that the app handlers communicated with investors through at least three WhatsApp groups. They established a chain system where investors recruited others. For example, there were 12 investors under him, and 16 investors under his wife. The handlers claimed to be a company based in Japan and never communicated with investors verbally.
Many investors had concerns about the legitimacy of these investments, but continued to invest money into accounts provided by the application. One victim, who wished to remain anonymous, said most of the victims of this fraud are lower-middle class individuals employed in various service jobs.
“Some work as shop assistants, mobile mechanics, or motor mechanics. There are even home guard volunteers working in the police department. I was warned by a relative that such schemes are often fraudulent, and that such companies tend to vanish after some time in the market. I initially thought of investing a small amount but reinvested after receiving returns on my initial investment,” the victim added.
A police officer confirmed the fraud, adding that the police have gathered investment statements, WhatsApp messages, and details of account numbers of at least five victims. “People from Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, andUttar Pradeshhave also invested in the Foxccon app. Complaints against the mobile app continue to pour in,” the officer added.
A case has been registered at the Cyber Cell police station in Sector 17.

"In a single-bedroom house in Yelahanka on the northern fringe of Bengaluru, a 33-year-old MBA graduate and a 36-year-old software engineer allegedly set up a nameless private enterprise two years ago. Two youths hired as employees lived in the house and were tasked with keeping eight mobile phones active – day and night.
In the second week of September this year, theBengaluru cyber crime police arrested the MBA graduate,Manoj Sreenivas, the software engineer, Phanindra K, and four others.
It was a complaint of cheating to the tune of Rs 8.5 lakh filed by a 26-year-old woman, who was lured – first on an app and later on a WhatsApp group – to make small investments for high returns, that led the cyber crime police to their doorstep.
The probe has found that the house taken on rent by Sreenivas and Phanindra was allegedly a back office for a massive fraud network operating across India, where thousands of people have been cheated after being lured on social media to invest small amounts for high returns.
The investigations by the cyber crime police into the network in Bengaluru has revealed that as much as Rs 854 crore moved rapidly through 84 bank accounts in the last two years. When the police traced these accounts and froze them in September, only Rs 5 crore remained.
When the cyber crime police went a step further and looked on the National Cyber Crime Portal, they found 5,013 cases across India where the same set of accounts had been used by cyber criminals. There were 17 cases from Bengaluru itself out of 487 reported fromKarnataka. Police also found that 719 cases had been reported fromTelangana, 642 from Gujarat, and 505 fromUttar Pradesh.
Investigations have found that Rs 854 crore that travelled through the 84 accounts was moved to gaming apps, cryptocurrency like USDT, online casinos and payment gateways, to be encashed by the fraud’s main operators, who are suspected to based in Dubai and whom the Bengaluru layer of operators never met physically.
Police are probing whether the Dubai-based operators, who set up the network by communicating only through social media to the Bengaluru layer, are linked to Chinese operatives.
A similar case had unravelled in July inHyderabad, where the cyber crime police revealed that 15,000 victims had been cheated of Rs 712 crore through 113 bank accounts created for fake companies. In that case, local operatives were found to be linked to Dubai-based operators with China links. The Hyderabad probe also found a terror funding link, where some of the funds were allegedly diverted to crypto wallets linked to the Hezbollah group.
“In the Bengaluru case, no links to China operators or any terror financing has been found. Investigations are still underway to find the key operatives,” Bengaluru police commissioner B Dayananda said on September 30.
“Indian operators received a commission of one to three percent on every transaction they facilitated. They opened local bank accounts without going through the KYC process,” Bengaluru cyber crime official Haziresh Tilledar said.
Local operatives were asked to use an app that would send clones of bank OTPs (sent to the local phone numbers linked to fake bank accounts) to the Dubai operators as well – to make it seem like the fake accounts were being operated locally.
Police suspect the motive behind keeping eight mobile phones constantly active was to facilitate fund transfers between fake bank accounts and mule accounts, and to siphon the money out through crypto currency, gaming apps and online casinos.
“The online casinos and gaming apps seem to be a key source of money laundering as there are no records of winnings. One of the main accused was planning on starting his own gaming app to launder his own earnings from the fraud,” a Bengaluru police official said.

“The laundered money goes through international banks and is shown as investments in various foreign companies,” Bengaluru police stated.
The probe has found that the local operatives invested as much as Rs 1.37 crore of funds earned from the racket on software, a casino, a resort and a garment factory.
According to police officials, the gangs would lure victims through WhatsApp and Telegram. “Initially, they are asked to invest small amounts ranging from Rs 1,000 to 10,000 on the pretext that they would earn Rs 1,000 to 5,000 per day as profit,” a police official said.
In the case registered in Bengaluru on April 28, the 26-year-old victim told the police that her friend had come across an app called ‘The Winegroup’, where she earned some returns on small investments. The victim, too, decided to download the app.
“We were made a part of a WhatsApp group called ‘Small Group of TWG2006’ which had six group admins (with different phone numbers). I asked some of my friends to join as well. They deposited small amounts of returns to my bank account. I started to transfer more funds (to 29 UPI IDs) amounting to Rs 8.5 lakh. The group admins later refused to pay the principal amount or the returns. They did not respond to messages,” the victim stated.
Investigation by the Bengaluru police received an impetus when the cyber crime police found a bank employee who had helped open one of the fraudulent bank accounts in the name of a fake company in Karnataka, where the funds were transferred.
When the police tracked down the suspect, Vasanth Kumar, who had opened the bank account, they found that he along with an associate Chakradhar were allegedly entrusted by a network to open accounts in the name of fake companies.
“The probe revealed that the funds swindled from the victims in the Bengaluru case were first transferred to an account of a fake firm inTamil Naduand then to the account of another firm in Karnataka,” police sources said.
“When the person in whose name the account was opened was questioned, he reported that he was not linked to the bank account and that his credentials may have been misused,” the Bengaluru police said.
As many as 45 bank accounts linked to the two fake firms in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have been unearthed by the police. “There were no employees or offices for these companies. They are shell companies,” police said.
“This is probably the first time bank accounts involved in an online fraud have been tracked on NCRP records to ascertain the extent of a cyber crime,” an official said.
“There may be similar local gangs in other parts of the country. We are writing to the Directorate of Enforcement to conduct further investigations,” police said.
In bail hearings following their arrest on September 9, Sreenivas and Kumar argued that they had been falsely implicated by the police. “The complainant voluntarily invested the amount, the petitioners have not approached her to deposit,” the accused argued.
A local Bengaluru court granted bail in one of the cases on September 30, but they are still being held in other cases registered in Bengaluru over the last two years.
The Karnataka high court has also granted an interim stay on investigations in the cyber crime in which the six men were arrested, but there are 16 other cases against them.

"The rapid advancement of technology has provided cybercriminals with new ways to exploit victims. From hacking personal information to financial frauds to using Artificial Intelligence (AI), the sophistication of cybercrimes continues to evolve. This article will tell you what to do first and how to report a cybercrime if you unfortunately happen to be a victim of a cybercrime.
Some common cybercrimes:
Phishing: It is a technique where attackers use deceptive emails or messages to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information or performing actions they shouldn’t.

"A 68-year-old resident of Pune was duped of Rs 24.85 lakh by fraudsters who posed asBitcoin tradersand lured the elderly person to invest in dubious funds. The victim lodged a First Information Report (FIR) at the Sahkarnagar police station Friday.
The police said the victim is a resident of a bungalow in the Sahkarnagar area. He got calls on his phone in September 2021 from the fraudsters who identified themselves as Evon Sarah and Babu Bordoloi.
They allegedly assured huge profits to the victim if he invested his money in a Bitcoin trading business. The police said between September 2021 and February 2022, the victim transferred Rs 24.85 lakh to Bordoloi throughPaytmthrough multiple online transactions.
However, he never made any profit and also lost the money he had invested as per the instructions of the fraudsters. Unable to recover his money, the victim complained to the cyber police.
After verification of the complaint, anFIRwas lodged against the accused under Sections 419 (Punishment for cheating by personation), 420 (Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and sections of the Information Technology Act. Further investigation is on.
The cyber police have suggested that investors should use only trusted platforms to deal in cryptocurrencies and stressed that investors should research the names of the cryptocurrency exchanges and check if they use similar sounding names as those of known platforms.
“We are even advising people to research on types and modus operandi of frauds in cryptocurrency investments before they start putting their money. They should also stick to reputed crypto markets and exercise high caution while investing in newer platforms,” said an officer from the Cyber police station.

"With increase in cybercrime cases across the country, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah Wednesday said that the police need to be proactive in preventing cybercrimes as the consequences “are alarming”.
He was speaking after inaugurating a one-day conference of Director General of Polices (DGPs) of southern states and senior officials from central police organisations held at Bengaluru.
“The number of cyber attacks in the country has increased over the years. It has become very common. It not only harms an individual but also poses a threat to national security. Cyber attacks and crimes have led to financial losses, damaged reputation leading to endangering lives in some of the cases. There is a need to use advanced forensic tools in investigation of cybercrimes that are helpful in tracking down cyber criminals and securing the digital evidence needed for prosecutions,” he added.
He also pointed outKarnataka’s proactive measures in tackling cybercrimes, being the first state in the country to establish a cybercrime police station back in 2003. Now, every district and every division commissionerate has Cyber Economic and Narcotics Crime (CEN) police stations which deal with cybercrimes.
Urging law enforcers to be one step ahead of criminals,Siddaramaiahpointed that the threat of terrorism needs to be dealt with better coordination among the states. “The terror threats have continued to evolve and Karnataka has been witnessing it since 1990. Intelligence gathering and sharing information among the state will play a crucial role to curb terror activities,” he said.
“The threat of terrorism continues to evolve, becoming more and more sophisticated and global in nature. Karnataka has faced incidents of terrorism since 1990. Though all cases were detected and proper charge sheets were filed, some ended in conviction and some are still under trial. Law enforcing agencies should always be on high alert. Better coordination, intelligence gathering and sharing of information amongst states will be very vital. You must prioritise intelligence gathering, coordination, cooperation and targeted actions against terrorist organisations,” he said.
The Chief Minister said the police should adapt to evolving challenges, from traditional criminal activities to the digital sector. He emphasised the need for continuous modification of police tactics and strategies to combat modern forms of crime effectively.
Siddaramaiah praised the Karnataka Police for their efforts in drug control, international drug network busts and apprehending drug peddlers. While Naxal activities have been curbed in the state, he stressed the importance of cooperation between Karnataka, Kerala, andTamil Naduto address the issue.
Stating that crimes now have no borders, he said there is a need for mutual exchange of information, resources and techniques among the states to combat crimes. He emphasised that inter-state coordination is essential, given the diverse cultural backgrounds, languages and geographical challenges in South India.

"The Cyber Crime Cell of the Pune city police have arrested a suspect from Bihar in connection with a fraud in which a well known Pune-based real estate development company lost Rs 66 lakh in May.
Posing as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the company, the Cyber fraudsters had sent messages to the Accounting Vice President of the firm directing her to make three large transfers to a few accounts, which later turned out to be fraudulent, in a span of less than two hours.
AnFIRwas registered on May 18 by the 50-year-old Accounting VP of the company, on whose official phone number the fraudulent messages were sent on the afternoon of May 8.
According to the police, the complainant had received a message from an unidentified number in which the sender had identified himself as the CEO of the company. The message said that the number was his “very personal number” and that it should not be shared with anyone. The message further said that that he was in a meeting and would not like to be disturbed.
The message instructed the VP to make a transfer of Rs 9.8 lakh to a bank account. Trusting the message, the VP asked her staffer to make the payment. Over the next two hours, two messages were received on the VP’s official phone directing her to make transfers of Rs 35.9 lakh and Rs 20.7 lakh.
Both the transfers were made immediately. However, while these transfers were being made, the VP kept calling the number and kept getting the reply ‘Don’t call.’ The complainant checked the said phone number on an online caller identification application and it displayed the name and photo of the CEO.
A while later, the complainant checked with the Personal Assistant of the CEO and then connected with the CEO himself to find out that no such instructions had been given by him.

"The Cyber Crime Cell of the Pune city police have arrested a suspect from Bihar in connection with a fraud in which a well known Pune-based real estate development company lost Rs 66 lakh in May.
Posing as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the company, the Cyber fraudsters had sent messages to the Accounting Vice President of the firm directing her to make three large transfers to a few accounts, which later turned out to be fraudulent, in a span of less than two hours.
AnFIRwas registered on May 18 by the 50-year-old Accounting VP of the company, on whose official phone number the fraudulent messages were sent on the afternoon of May 8.
According to the police, the complainant had received a message from an unidentified number in which the sender had identified himself as the CEO of the company. The message said that the number was his “very personal number” and that it should not be shared with anyone. The message further said that that he was in a meeting and would not like to be disturbed.
The message instructed the VP to make a transfer of Rs 9.8 lakh to a bank account. Trusting the message, the VP asked her staffer to make the payment. Over the next two hours, two messages were received on the VP’s official phone directing her to make transfers of Rs 35.9 lakh and Rs 20.7 lakh.
Both the transfers were made immediately. However, while these transfers were being made, the VP kept calling the number and kept getting the reply ‘Don’t call.’ The complainant checked the said phone number on an online caller identification application and it displayed the name and photo of the CEO.
A while later, the complainant checked with the Personal Assistant of the CEO and then connected with the CEO himself to find out that no such instructions had been given by him. Meanwhile, more messages seeking further fund transfers were received but they were not responded to because it had become clear that the company had been cheated by cyber fraudsters. A probe was launched by a team from the cyber crime police station.
During the probe into various technical leads and information of the bank accounts used by the cyber criminals, the investigators zeroed in on a suspect identified as Bishal Kumar Bharat Manjhi (23), who hails from Siwan in Bihar.

"A resident of a high-rise society in Greater Noida lost over Rs 13 lakh after she allegedly fell into a WhatsApp message trap of a work-from-home job offer to watch, like and subscribe YouTube videos, officials said. Later on, thefraudsters luredthe woman with higher returns by asking her to invest on a fake Nasdaq website, they said. She kept sending money to the link and also took a loan of Rs 6 lakh in the hope of getting higher returns, they said.
Kartika, a resident of the Panchsheel Hynish Society of Greater Noida West, stated in her complaint that fraudsters who had remote access to her computer also created a fake website.
“On April 6, I received a WhatsApp message on my mobile number related to the part-time job offer, in which it was mentioned that they will provide a job, where I will have to see videos on YouTube, like and subscribe to the channel. They connected me to a Telegram handle and further communication happened there. They offered me Rs 50 to Rs 5,000 per day for the task,” Kartika, a resident of Panchsheel Hynish Society of Greater Noida West, stated in her complaint.
The cybercriminals credited Rs 150 to her account after she ‘liked and subscribed’ three video links sent to her on the first day of job; ie; April 6, and credited another Rs 150 for subscribing to the next three videos.
“Being a housewife, it looked like an easy job that I could do while taking care of my three-year-old son,” said Kartika while adding that the scammers asked her to create an account on the US-based Nasdaq website, the link of which was shared to her.
“They asked me to invest Rs 2,000 in Nasdaq and returned Rs 3,150 to me on the same day as profit,” she said.
The cybercriminals gave her a series of three mandatory tasks, and Kartika kept sending Rs 5000, Rs 30,000 and Rs 90,000 in turns. “I did not get my money back. They said that the third task, that I did, was wrong. Then they gave me a new task of two transactions, where I sent them Rs, 2,18,400 and Rs 3,81,200. After every transaction, they said that the next transaction will be the last transaction. I ran short of funds and was very scared at this point,” the woman said in her complaint.
In the hope of getting the money back, Kartika bought some time from the fraudsters and applied for a personal loan in her husband’s name. “My husband applied for a personal loan from his account. Then I paid Rs 2.50 lakh as a final transaction and demanded all my money back. After this they said ‘Your amount is above Rs 10 lakh and therefore you need to invest more to clear the Rs 15 lakh threshold’ to get the payment,” she elaborated.
The couple took another personal loan when the scammers demanded Rs 3,37,600 to complete the threshold. “At this time, we were mentally choked and unable to digest what was happening to us and how we had destroyed ourselves financially in the past few hours,” Kartika said in her complaint.
After the couple paid the amount, the fraudsters sought Rs 5,20,000 as tax amount. It was at this point the couple realised that they were duped and lodged a complaint, said the police.
“We also tried to withdraw money from Nasdaq but nothing happened,” said the woman in her complaint. The police have registered a case of cheating by personation and section 66D of Information Technology (Amendments) Act, 2008 against unknown persons.

"A day after The Indian Express reported on thearrestof a 21-year-old Kolkata-based man who allegedly duped several people by promising to “double their investment within minutes”, the Kalachowkie police on Saturday said three social media influencers have also been booked in the case.
The police said the social media influencers — Akshay Athare, Mansi Suravase and Ankita Bhagat — helped promote the crypto scamster Instagram account.
“These influencers have been misleading people by claiming (in promotional videos) that they invested their money and it doubled within a few minutes. That is why they have been booked,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone IV) Prashant Kadam said.
According to the police, a case was registered at Kalachowkie police station on June 23 following which the accused, Mohammad Hamza Zaki Anwar, was traced at Khidirpur inKolkata. A team was sent to his residence and he was arrested. “Several people in the same district have been committing similar crimes of duping people,” a police officer said.
According to the police, Anwar, who is a Class 12 pass-out, created an Instagram account called Crypto_Anaisha through which he had been allegedly duping people by claiming he could double their money in 30 to 35 minutes by investing it in crypto currency.
The accused even put out ads and promotions on Instagram. Several people approached him and were ultimately duped. The complainant in the case also came across one such promotion by a social media influencer. “We have learnt that Athare was paid Rs 30,000 in July 2022 for promoting Anwar’s Instagram account for two to three days while Suravase was paid Rs 40,000. Ankita was paid Rs 25,000 in July 2022 to promote his account,” an officer said.
The police said Athare and Suravase’s statements were recorded, they were served notice and allowed to go. “These influencers have followers in millions on their Instagram accounts and when they post such promotional videos, their followers believe they themselves invested their money, which doubled. There are no such schemes by the government that these influencers are promoting. Instead they were helping a fraudster get more people to fall for such claims… that’s why we have booked them,” an officer said.

"The Mumbai police arrested two persons from Rajasthan in connection with a case where Rs 19 lakh were fraudulently transferred from a business account of a south Mumbai trader. The police have found that the two accused were using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) device to hide their location.
An officer said the director of a southMumbai-based pharmaceutical company had approached the police in the last week of June after he found that Rs 19 lakh had been illegally transferred from their business account. The complainant said that in spite of not having made any transfer, the net banking facility had been illegally used to make the transfer.
The south region cyber police station took over the probe and began investigation. During the probe, it came to light that the transfer had been made by accessing the internet through the mobile phone of aRajasthan-based person.
A police team then left for Jaipur and traced the person, identified as Satyender Rajawat (44) and his partner Mukesh Choudhary (35), both e-commerce businessmen. The police found that the accused had been using VPN from another service provider in order to hide the location from where the transfers were made.
The police issued a notice to the accused asking them to appear before them in Mumbai. When the duo appeared before the south region cyber police, the police, following interrogation, decided to place them under arrest for custodial interrogation. The two accused were produced before a holiday court and remanded to police custody.
While seeking their custody, the police said they were yet to recover the money they had transferred and also identify the other accused who are involved in the scam.

"A software engineer working in Pune was targeted in a bizarre online fraud in which cyber criminals gained access to her net banking account on the pretext of suspending her credit card. They not only stole Rs 4.7 lakh from her account but also got a pre-approved personal loan of Rs 2 lakh in her name and then withdrew Rs 6.7 lakh in seven transactions within 40 minutes.
AFirst Information Report(FIR) in the case has been registered at the Hinjewadi police station by the woman, 24, who works at thePuneoffice of a multinational Information Technology services major.
According to her complaint, she got a call on the afternoon of May 1 from an unidentified number at 1 pm. The caller claimed to be an executive of the bank she has an account with. The caller said she had two credit cards issued in her name and one of them was not yet activated and asked if she wanted to suspend it or get it activated. The complainant told the caller she would like it to be suspended.
Subsequently, on the pretext of verifying her request, the caller sought the details of her bank account and the PAN number among other things. Then asking her to share the one-time password (OTP) sent to her, the cyber criminals allegedly gained access to her net banking account and replaced her mail address with an address of the name ‘thedarkpartoflife’, officials said.
Within minutes of doing this, the cyber criminals obtained a pre-approved personal loan of Rs 2 lakh in the complainant’s name, about which she received a message. At this point, the complainant realised that she was being cheated. However, before she could take any steps, the cyber criminals siphoned off Rs 6.7 lakh from her bank account.
The complainant then approached the police station after which an FIR under various sections of the Information Technology Act and the Indian Penal Code (IPC) related to cheating and criminal breach of trust was registered. A probe has been launched into the contact details and bank accounts used by the cybercriminals.
Cyber investigators have said victims of cyber frauds and online financial scams should approach the police during the ‘golden hours’ or within 24 hours after the crime has taken place. Investigators said while early complaints can give them an edge in the probe, they can also initiate immediate measures to freeze the fraudulent accounts and try to ensure that the money is not lost.

"In a major push against cyber crime and online fraud, Haryana has listed more than 34,000 cellphone numbers in a year for blocking, making for nearly every second such mobile number reported from across the country, it has been learnt.
The numbers include more than 11,000 that were used to make calls from state’s Mewat region — one of the emerging cyber crime hotspots. Most of the blocked SIM cards, however, had origin outside the state — mainlyAndhra Pradesh,West Bengaland Delhi, it has been learnt.

Haryana, reported 34,276 phone numbers linked to cyber crime for blocking in 2022-2023, making for nearly 94 such requests per day. The numbers were reported on Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre, popularly known as I4C. It was followed byTamil Nadu(21,572 such numbers), and Gujarat (10,631). Jharkhand, home to Jamtara which remains one of the most notorious hotspots from here highest number of cyberfraud calls are generated, is placed at number four in reporting such number, as per the data conveyed by the MHA to the Haryana State Crime Branch.
Additional DGP (Crime) OP Singh, said, “Out of the total mobilenumbers reported on the portal by us, 20,545 have been blocked. The process of blocking the remaining numbers is underway.”
Most of the blocked SIM cards — 12,822— were issued in Andhra Pradesh, followed by West Bengal (4,365), Delhi (4,338) and Assam (2,322).
“These SIM cards are smuggled into the state and are often sold to the fraudsters for as much as Rs 500 a piece,” said a senior Crime Branch official, part of the team carrying out investigations in cyber crime cases. It is being probed if fake or morphedAadhaarnumbers were used to procure the SIM cards, the official added.
The investigating teams procured the tower dump from 40 villages in Mewat region — the area from where 11,000 such mobile numbers were used to make calls to people and which were reported on the I4C. It was found that most of these SIM cards were issued in Andhra Pradesh.
To ensure that criminals do not use one SIM card for multiple frauds, the I4C has changed the procedure for disconnecting mobile connections. Earlier, the state used to write to the telephone service provider and the entire process would take time, leaving scope for the fraudsters to defraud multiple people with the same number.
Now, I4C has issued a special link on the National Cybercrime Reporting Portal, bringing all telecom service providers on a single platform with law enforcement agencies. Now, the state nodal office for cyber crime can report cases of malicious use of phone numbers and get them blocked immediately.
“Once we get a complaint on the 1930 helpline or the cybercrime portal, we report the number to I4C and it is blocked,” the official added.
As per the procedure, the team monitoring the National Cybercrime Reporting Portal and the National Cybercrime Helpline number, 1930, promptly sends blocking requests to the licensed service area (LSA) concerned. These requests are initiated by the Department of Telecommunication as soon as a mobile phone number comes to its notice.
The crime branch, as the nodal agency for cybercrime in Haryana, has deployed a team of 40 highly skilled personnel to man the 1930 helpline.
A senior official said, now there is a provision under which they get the banks to freeze the accounts used by fraudsters.
“On receiving the complaint, we immediately take up with the bank, which holds the victim’s account. The bank informs us about the account or accounts in which the money has been transferred. We then send a formal request to freeze the accounts. If the crime reported within two hours, the amount that has been transferred can be blocked,” the official added.
Meanwhile, Haryana has reported an increase of 138 per cent in cases where people who have children or family member abroad have been duped. In most such cases, those in India receive a call stating that their family members abroad were found involved in a brawl or smuggling drugs or have met with an accident and need money.
According to the data by Haryana State Crime Branch, 298 such cases were reported in the period April 1, 2022 to March 31, 2023. In all these cases, people received calls informed that their foreign connections required money immediate money. In 2021-2022, state had recorded 125 such cases, up from 113 reported in 2020-2021.
In these cases, the State Crime branch is probing the role of some currency exchange firms.

"Mumbai police have exposed a ring of cybercriminals that stole money from people from across the country by posing as police personnel and arrested its kingpin, who has studied till Class 12 and used to do transactions of more than Rs 5 crore a day in his accounts, an official said on Wednesday.
Mastermind Shrinivas Rao Dadi (49), who has sound technical knowledge despite limited education, was taken into custody by a team of Bangur Nagar police station from a plush hotel inHyderabad, the official said.
Besides Dadi, police also arrested four more members of his gang, including two from neighbouring Thane and as many fromKolkata, he said.
Dadi pretended to run a real estate business and used to communicate only through the Telegram app. Police have so far frozen 40 bank accounts used by Dadi and recovered cash of Rs 1.5 crore from him, the official said.
Explaining the modus operandi of the cyber fraudsters, the official said that Dadi and his accomplices would call people, mostly women, posing as police officers and tell them that cops have found drugs or weapons in a courier sent by them, he said.
The caller would then demand the bank or income tax-related details saying those were needed to verify if the courier didn’t belong to the person they were speaking with.
Ajay Kumar Bansal, deputy commissioner of police (zone -11), said most people would get scared by the phone call and share their bank or IT details. Victims also shared the one time password (OTP) and in some cases allowed the fraudsters to take control of their mobile phones by downloading apps like AnyDesk, the official said.
After accessing key details, the fraudsters would steal money from the victim’s bank account. The cyber gang targeted thousands of people from across the country using this method, he said.
All money stolen by the gang would go into bank accounts managed by Dadi. The accounts had transactions of Rs 5 crore to Rs 10 crore a day, said the official. Dadi would then convert the money into cryptocurrency and transfer it to a Chinese national, said the official.
To investigate the case, city police teams are in Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Jharkhand, Haryana and other places inMaharashtraand more arrests are expected, he said.

"“Good Day Dear! I am HR Aina Ivers…I would like to offer you a part time job,” reads a message on the WhatApp received from an international number. Another message sent with a different name “HR Shanaya” reads, “You can earn rupees here by liking YouTube videos and sending screenshots.”
Pune’s cyber crime investigators say these messages are the gateways to elaborate online frauds, being termed as “task frauds” by them. The Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad police together have registered at least dozen cases of such online scams over the past three months in which complainants, ranging from young IT engineers to elderly retired Army personnel, have lost close to Rs 2.7 crore.
Here is a look at how these latest cyber scams work in which, investigators say, scamsters exploit what is known as the “sunk-cost fallacy”, like in many other cyber scams.
“Our investigation suggests that a large number of citizens are receiving these messages. It is like the cyber criminals are spreading their fishing net and then waiting for the targets to get caught. What baffles us the most is the victims of these scams who have lost amounts ranging from Rs 10 lakh to over Rs one crore, are of strong educational backgrounds. Many even have technology and software degrees. And in spite of reporting of these cases across the media, people continue to fall prey to these scamsters,” said Senior Inspector Minal Patil, in-charge of Pune City Cyber Crime Police station.
The Indian Expresscame across at least 12 such instances over the past three months, with several cases registered over the past one-and-a-half months. Consider some of the key cases:
* An Army veteran, in his 60s, who responded to scamsters who contacted him in February, lost Rs 1.1 crore in a span of two weeks where he made as many 26 online transfers to over a dozen bank accounts.
* Between February and April, a business analyst with an IT company, who is in her 40s in Pune, lost Rs 47 lakh to a cyber fraudster. She made 18 online payments eithers on to bank accounts or to online payment platform accounts.
* An engineering professional in his late 20s lost Rs 9 lakh over 19 transactions after he started responding to a message from “HR Meera Mehta”.
* A doctor from Pune, who is in her early 50s, lost over Rs 23 lakh to cyber criminals after she fell prey to the money for task lure.
* This month, a 40-year-old engineer from Pimpri Chinchwad fell prey to the similar scam and lost Rs 57 lakh.
Inspector Chandrashekhar Sawant, from the Pune City Cyber Crime police station, who is probing multiple task fraud cases, said, “It starts with a message on WhatsApp, generally from international numbers. In most of the cases we have seen, the first message is from a scamster posing as HR representatives offering part-time jobs with good income. After a response from the receiver, they ask you to do tasks like liking YouTube videos, giving reviews of hotels, giving good ratings to online products, etc., and sending them screenshots. For every small task, the scamsters send you amounts like Rs 50, 100 per task. Once the target is lured, the scamster moves to the next stage. Now they add the target to a Telegram group for what they call prepaid tasks. If the targets do not have a Telegram app on the phone, they ask them to install it or help install it.”
Inspector Sawant said, “On Telegram, they make you believe that you have been promoted a level by adding you to Telegram groups of names suggesting a step above. It is at this stage that the scamsters start demanding money on the pretext of what they call prepaid tasks. Now they ask, for example, Rs 1,000 before a task, and then pay you back Rs 1,300 or Rs 1,500 after the task is complete. Here, the nature of tasks changes but does not go beyond the target requiring to just click, like or rate things. They then add the target to another higher level group where the value of prepaid tasks goes into lakhs. They seek, for example, Rs 2-3 lakh and promise higher returns.”
Now comes the twist in the tale.
“At one stage, they stop giving back the returns on these prepaid tasks using various pretexts — like further investment of those amounts into bitcoins or saying that there are issues with the payments. To return the money paid earlier, scamsters start demanding more and more money and in larger amounts. Expecting to recover the money after investing so much, the victims continue to pay up. As victims stop further payments and start demanding back their money after realising that they are being cheated, the scamsters close the communication channels and go incommunicado. In most cases, none of these communications are over calls, it is just texts on messenger apps,” Sawant said.
“The shift to Telegram from WhatsApp is for a reason. While WhatsApp generally shares with police entities the information about their users for investigation purposes, Telegram hardly ever responds to such requests,” another officer said.
Senior Inspector Minal Patil said, “The underlying broad method of the scam is similar to any other cyber fraud where the vulnerabilities of the victims are exploited by the criminals into making them pay money. Only the method of luring the targets and the pretexts of scamming have changed. We have launched coordinated probes into the multiple cases that we have reported over the last three months.”
A senior cyber investigator said, “There is a concept in behavioural economics termed as sunk cost fallacy where a person continues to invest in endeavours in spite of serious doubts of failure, especially because the person has already invested so much in it. They also exploit vulnerabilities like need, greed, fear and lack of application of common sense and logic in most cases.”
Tips from the cyber crime department to avoid falling prey to scamsters:
* Do not respond to messages offering money. Any scheme offered through phones offering unusually high returns is usually a scam.
* If you respond and make payments, approach the nearest police station or cyber crime wing as soon as possible.
* Consulting family members or friends in such situations. It can help in understanding frauds and getting the required emotional support.

"A 38-year-old woman from Gurugram was cheated of more than Rs 28 lakh on the pretext of working from home and earning money by giving ratings to movies on a fake website. In the last three days, this is the second such incident reported in Delhi-NCR.
On Thursday, a 33-year-old woman from Noida was alsocheated of Rs 12 lakh by unknown scamstersafter she was offered a job to rate movies. The police said both the women were a part of Telegram groups where the accused would ask the participants to send money to get “double” returns.
In Gurugram, the woman, identified as Meha Sethi (38), lodged a complaint from Sector 28 stating that she joined a closed group of Telegram last year in December. The woman was allegedly told she would be working as a movie critic/agent who will have to rate movies for a reputed American Cinema company ‘Alamo Drafthouse Cinema’.
The accused sent the participants a website linkhttp://www.iflixwork.comto rate movies. From December till February this year, the woman sent money to various bank accounts to earn a “profit” later by rating movies.
The police said the woman took a loan from her family as she believed it was a work-from-home gig. She then paid the money on different occasions as per “tasks”. However, she didn’t receive any returns and was further pushed to send more money in the name of income tax deductions.
“These various payments were obtained from me on forged assurances that on completion of tasks, which was to give ratings to movies, I’ll be receiving my money back along with good incentives. Now, they are neither returning my payments nor incentives and asking for more money in the name of income tax. Now, I have a gut feeling that they have cheated me and ruined me by taking away all my life savings fraudulently and under duress,” reads theFIRlodged on the woman’s complaint.
A senior police officer said the scamsters made her spend money through “small transactions” to cheat her for a longer period of time.
“They had repaid her the principal amount by deducting some commission. They then gave her more tasks – to rate movies on their site and send more money for profits. She lost a total of Rs 28 lakh,” said the officer.
A case has been registered against unknown persons while the mobile numbers, and transaction details and the website are being checked.
In the Noida case, the 33-year-old woman had alleged she was told to pay Rs 10,000 initially and click 30 times on a link to get double the money. She was then asked to pay more money in the name of getting better returns. The Noida police are yet to make any arrests in the case.

"Since January 1 last year, the Haryana Police’s Cyber Crime Cell has blocked almost 5 lakh SIM cards that were in use in the state’s Mewat region to commit cyber frauds across the country. The SIM cards were in use in nearly 40 villages, with police identifying at least 402 alleged criminals involved in cyber frauds.
The police were acting on 66,784 complaints made between January 1, 2022, and December 31, 2022, with Rs 301.48 crore allegedly lost to cybercrimes originating from Mewat, a region in Haryana’s Nuh district that has gained notoriety for being a hotbed of cybercrime.
So far, the Cyber Cell has registered 2,165 cases, arrested 1,065 people and made recoveries or put on hold suspected fraudulent transactions to the tune of Rs 46.91 crore. Officials said the fraudulent SIM cards were identified with the help of Artificial Intelligence and Facial Recognition Powered Solution for Telecom SIM Subscriber Verification (ASTR), a tool developed by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT).
A senior officer said, “We used cell tower dump analysis in Mewat to identify 4,96,562 mobile numbers issued from other states but used exclusively in this region. We have identified 15,672 more numbers and blocked 1,959. Eleven suo moto cases have been registered. Suspicious links with other states were found in six of these cases. The details have been shared with the states concerned.”
The officer said they noticed multiple uses of the same International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number (a unique 15-digit code that identifies a device). “The fraudsters were simply using a SIM card to make a call, then switching off the phone, removing that SIM, putting a new SIM in the same phone to make the next call and so on.”
Senior officers said that while a maximum of six SIM cards can be issued on a single identity proof, in several cases, over a dozen cards had been procured.
Additional Director General of Police (State Crime Branch) O P Singh said instructions have been issued to mobile network operators for verification of documents submitted to procure SIM cards.
From two villages in 2018 to 40, Mewat in Nuh district has ended up on the cybercrime map of India. While the fraudsters have expanded their network, police have kept pace by employing new technology and surveillance tools to. The mass blocking of SIM cards is a step in this direction.
Explaining the modus operandi, a senior officer said, “One person arranges for SIM cards using fake documents, the second gets bank accounts and payment applications linked to these SIM cards, the third uses another SIM card to call and dupe potential targets, while the fourth withdraws the money. The offenders mostly target people living far away to evade arrest.”
A senior officer toldThe Indian Expressthat the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has raised concerns over cybercrime in Mewat. In a meeting with an MHA official on February 6, the Crime Branch’s Cyber Cell had proposed that “the jurisdiction of the investigation be shifted from the state of the victim to the state of the accused for instant apprehension”.
Singh explained, “For example, a criminal in Haryana dupes a Kerala resident of Rs 40,000. As per rules, the case will be registered in Kerala. The Kerala police will start a probe to trace the accused to Haryana. They will then come all the way to Haryana to identify the fraudster’s location and make an arrest. This process involves time and money. Even complainants back out at times. If the probe jurisdiction is shifted to the offender’s state, the nearest police station can simply nab the accused. The Kerala police will then be intimated to pick up the criminal.”

"From quoting iconic Bollywood songs and dialogues to sharing memes, the Rajasthan Police is using popular culture as a tool to raise awareness among youngsters about online luring and fake social media profiles during the ongoing Valentine’s week.
The creative messages, with a twist of humour, are being shared by the state police force on its officialFacebookaccount and Twitter handle to grab the attention of youngsters who might easily fall prey to scamsters.
The social media posts are also being used to desist the youth from following gangsters on social media.
A tweet shared on ‘Chocolate Day’ (February 9) was the iconic poster from the blockbuster film ‘3 Idiots’.
Captioned “jahapanah tussi great ho, chocolate kubool karo,” a famed dialogue from the film, it alerted people to stay away from “digital chocolate” and adopt cyber safety to ensure “all is well” — a catchphrase of one of the lead protagonists as well as a hit song from the 2009 movie.
Warning people against sharing their OTPs with anyone, a post on ‘Rose Day’ (February 7) had the image of a WhatsApp inbox with two people chatting about how one of them lost all savings due to an online scam.
A caption at the bottom of the image read, “roz roz tum jo sanam aisa karoge, paise lut jayenge to aahen bharoge (If you keep on doing this, you will lose all your money)” — a parody of a song from the 1996 Bollywood blockbuster “Saajan Chale Sasural”.
And for girls, police came up with a creative message to caution them about how fake profiles on social media can harm them.
“Kal aaj aur kal, kabhi bhi aa sakta hai fake proposal,” the post read.
Additional Director General (Technical Services) Sunil Dutt said the plans of cyber criminals can be thwarted if there is awareness among the masses.
And linking Valentine’s week with cyber crime is an effort in that direction, he said.
Though it is a long-term campaign ofRajasthanPolice to make people aware about cyber crimes, we picked Valentine’s week to reach out to youngsters, Dutt said.
Talking about the force’s latest post shared on ‘Promise Day’ on Saturday, the officer said a poster from the cult film “Gangs Of Wasseypur” has been used to desist people from getting influenced by gangsters through social media posts.
“Hazrat, hazrat, hazrat, aaj ka pakka promise, na gansgters ko karenge follow na kisi ko karne denge (let’s promise not to follow gangsters and discourage others from doing so),” read the caption accompanying the poster depicting actor Manoj Bajpayee.
According to officials, the social media team of the Rajasthan Police has been quite active for some time now and similar creative campaigns have been launched from time to time over the last one-and-a-half years.
Film songs, poetry, punchlines, and dialogues from popular Hindi movies are being used in the campaigns, they said.
Interesting messages are easily understood by the common man. Earlier, on occasions like Holi, and New Year’s Eve, such campaigns were launched and proved to be very popular, the officer said.
Meanwhile, people too are appreciating the innovative initiative albeit with some suggestions.
“It is a humble request to put a ban on all kinds of songs and events that promote gun culture. Also, instructions should be given to You Tube and Instagram to not encourage them,” tweeted Dharm Bainada.
Another social media user, Vishwadeep said, “Rajasthan Police is doing a great job to reform youngsters who have deviated from the path of goodness. I would like to thank the officers running this campaign and also the entire police department.”

"A 57-year-old businessman fell prey to an alleged cyberfraud when he acknowledged a ‘non-payment of bill’ message on his phone purportedly sent by the electricity department, said the police.
The victim, a resident of Chembur, was tricked into revealing hisPaytmandGooglePay details on a dubious app a fraudster had told him to download. The fraudster then proceeded to siphon off Rs 3.47 lakh from his bank account, said the police.
The Chembur police registered aFirst Information Report(FIR) on January 16. The complainant, Rajeev Pandey, told the police the incident took place on January 12 when he called an unknown number that had sent him a message alerting him the electricity to his residence would be cut since last month’s bill was still due.
The fraudster, claiming to speak from Adani Electricity, told Pandey his payment for December was pending. He then asked Pandey to download the ‘QR App’ and make a nominal payment of Rs 1. Pandey proceeded to do as the accused asked and tried paying the amount on the app almost four times with two of his UPI apps. Eventually, the fraudster withdrew Rs 3,47,803 from the victim’s account, the police said.
The Chembur police registered a case under Indian Penal Code sections 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating) and IT Act sections 66 C, (identity theft) and 66 D (cheating by personation by using computer resource).

"The comparative data of the number of complaints received under various cyber crime heads by Pune City police between 2021 and 2022 shows that five categories showed a sharp increase. These are online loan application frauds and extortion, sextortion, cheating related to cryptocurrency investment, Know Your Customer (KYC) information update and power bill frauds.
The National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal defines a cyber crime as ‘any unlawful act where a computer or communication device or computer network is used to commit or facilitate the commission of crime’. The Cyber Crime police station is the nodal entity ofPuneCity police that takes preliminary cognizance of cyber crime cases. The Cyber Crime police station, after conducting a preliminary inquiry into a case, registers theFirst Information Report(FIR) with itself, if the crime is of a serious nature and requires specialised probe or the fraud amount is very large. In other cases, the cyber police directs the local police station concerned to further probe the case by registering the FIR.
After recently taking over as the Commissioner of Police of Pune City, Retesh Kumaarr had said Pune requires more number of dedicated cyber crime police stations in addition to the existing one, considering the expanse of the city and the number of complaints received per year. He also said that training of available personnel in cyber crime investigation will be one of his priorities.
As per the comparative data shared by the Cyber Crime police station, in 2021 it received around 19,020 complaints while in 2022, it received around 19,400. The rise is in spite of the fact that since October 2022, a large chunk of complaints received were directly sent to the police stations following an organisational restructuring, and do not reflect in the data. A look at the data shows that five heads of cyber crime cases showed significant rise from 2021 to 2022.
Loan app, extortion
From 928 in 2021 to 3,471 cases in 2022, cases of frauds and extortion through online applications offering small loans formed a major chunk of the cyber crime complaints received by Pune City police. The victims fall prey to offers of small loans through online applications which offer quick credit ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 10,000. While giving the loans, the entities running the app gain access to the person’s contact list, photos etc. Few days after the disbursement of the loan, ‘executives’ of the loan app start demanding repayment — with large interest rates ranging from 30 to 300 per cent. If not repaid, these ‘executives’ threaten to send defamatory messages to victims’ contacts and morphed obscene images as they continue to harass and threaten the victims. In many cases they continue to extort money even after repayment with exorbitant interest rates.
Pune City police recently unearthed a major online extortion racket operating through these loan apps, whose suspected masterminds are based in China and Dubai. While probing cases of online extortion against loan app operatives Pune Cyber police station busted two fraudulent call centres in Bengaluru and arrested around 20 people. Police have also recovered data of about one lakh citizens across India who may have been targeted by these loan app racketeers. “Most of the victims turn to such apps in times of dire need of money. The racketeers take advantage of this situation,” said Senior Inspector Minal Patil, in-charge of the cyber crime police station.
Sextortion
In cases of online sextortion cyber criminals threaten to distribute private and sensitive material of the victims online and demand money or more images of sexual nature or sexual favours. From 652 in 2021 to 1,458 in 2022, cases of sextortion have more than doubled. Officials probing these cases have said the victims are contacted by the cyber criminals through fake profiles of attractive looking men or women on social media platforms or phone messengers. The perpetrators subsequently gain confidence and lure the victims into making video calls or sending images. In most cases these video calls are recorded. The victims are then blackmailed by the perpetrators into giving money, sexual favours and in some cases inside information or sensitive data that the victims have access to.
On September 28 last year, a 19-year-old student pursuing his Commerce degree allegedly ended his life by jumping from a building in Dattawadi area. Two days later, a 22-year-old Industrial Training student allegedly hanged himself to death. The police probe revealed that these young men were victims of sextortion. Both were threatened with circulation of their objectionable images on social media platforms and the cyber criminals were extorting money from them. Following the investigation, Pune police busted the sextortion racket and arrested the perpetrators from a village inRajasthan, from where a large number of such rackets were being operated. Pune police have also put in place a Standard Operating Procedure for the speedy and effective investigation into such cases of online sextortion.
Cryptocurrency
Number of people cheated through promises of large returns on investment in various cryptocurrency approaching Pune City police rose from 71 in 2021 to 154 in 2022. Officials said that with an increasing number of people investing in the virtual currency for higher returns, fraudulent platforms cheating people have also mushroomed. Officials from the cyber crime cell said that these frauds are perpetrated in broadly three ways. In some cases cyber criminals seek investment from people promising high returns on investment in known cryptocurrencies. In some cases cyber fraudsters claim to have created their own cryptocurrencies and cheat the investors through them. While in some cases suspects put up fraudulent exchanges for well-known virtual currencies and flee with investors’ money.
In one of the biggest breakthroughs in a cryptocurrency case, Pune City police’s cyber crime cell had in March last year arrested two cyber crime experts including an ex-IPS officer who had helped a Special Investigation Team of Pune police in the probe of two cases of multimillion dollar bitcoin ponzi scheme in 2018 and siphoned off large sums of cryptocurrency from the wallets of accused in those cases.
KYC update
From 552 in 2021 to 746 in 2022, the number of people falling prey to the Know Your Customer (KYC) frauds has also seen a significant rise. The victims receive calls, messages or emails seeking personal details and information of bank account, bank cards on the pretext of updating the KYC along with a threat or warning to freeze or deactivate the account. These fraudsters trick people into giving away login details, PINS, passwords or OTPs.
In some cases criminals gain access to the phones of the victims by asking them to install unauthorised applications or by making them click links. The criminals use this information or remote access to siphon money from the victims’ accounts or cards. Similar modus operandi is used in the case when victims are asked to update their KYC details for phone numbers, online phone payment platforms. The Reserve Bank of India has issued advisories in the past alerting bank customers about the KYC frauds.
Officials said that KYC update frauds are among the many methods of phishing used by the cyber criminals in which fraudsters use various means to scam people into revealing sensitive information. The RBI has also issued guidelines on safe digital banking practices.
Power bill frauds
Officials from the cyber crime cell said that in 2021, they did not have a separate category recording the cases in which people were cheated on the pretext of power bill payments. In 2022, looking at a much higher number of cases, these cases were separately documented. In 2022, the cyber crime cell received as many as 472 cases in which people were cheated. Officials estimate the number was less than 100 in 2021.
In these frauds, consumers receive messages saying their power supply will be disconnected for non-payment of bills or on the pretexts like ‘previous bill not updated.’ These messages in many cases have embedded links to download apps for payment or ask customers to contact WhatsApp numbers or email addresses. The perpetrators then gain remote access to phones of the users or use the information gathered to siphon money from the customers’ accounts.
TheMaharashtraState Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL) has issued an advisory to the consumers against fraudulent messages being sent with fake numbers or embedded links. MSEDCL has said that it only sends SMS alerts to consumers from sender IDs like VM-MSEDCL, VK-MSEDCL and under no circumstances personal numbers are given.

"Haryana Director General of Police (DGP) P K Agrawal on Thursday said 880 cybercriminals were arrested and Rs 44 crore were recovered from them during the year. Of them, 480 were arrested by the Faridabad and Gurugram police.
The DGP said till December 15, the Haryana Police received 62,089 complaints of cybercrime of which 26,885 have been disposed of. In the period, it had also registered 2,016 cases and worked out 605 of them.
Fifty-one cases of cybercrime were registered by police itself. These were cases in which complainants were not coming forward, and 24 of them have already been worked out, he said.
He also said steps are being taken to strengthen thePanchkula-based cyber forensic laboratory by recruiting additional technical hands, according to a statement. The DGP added that a proposal is under consideration to set up such labs at the police range and commissionerate headquarters.
Additional DGP, Crime Branch, O P Singh, said that in 2022, extortion through instant loan apps, phishing attacks and social engineering dominated case trends. “Instant loan apps involve people looking for quick loans and subsequently, social-shaming and blackmailing them into paying many times over. Phishing attacks involve hackers sending fake emails or creating fake websites in an attempt to trick victims into revealing sensitive information such as login credentials or financial information,” Singh said.
“These attacks have become increasingly sophisticated with hackers using branding and other tactics to make their emails and websites appear legitimate,” he said.
Singh said another area of concern was use of social engineering such as pretexting (creating a fake identity or situation to gain trust), baiting (offering something desirable to lure a victim) and scareware (using fear to manipulate the victim) for influencing individuals into performing actions or divulging sensitive information.The DGP called upon people and businesses to be vigilant against ever-mutating cybercrime and asked police personnel to fight this new class of crime with even greater vigour in the new year. Agarwal also urged victims of cybercrime to immediately report cases on helpline number ‘1930’.
Setting up cyber-desks at police stations has helped in mainstreaming cybercrime and “the initiative has been appreciated by the central government as one of the best practice in the country in gearing up police in fighting cybercrime”, he said. PTI

"A retired bank employee from Borivali (East), Mumbai, was duped of Rs. 9.15 lakh by cyber fraudsters when she tried registering a complaint with the bank. An FIR has been registered with the Dahisar police station under sections 419 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections 66 (C) and 66 (D) of the Information and Technology Act.
Police Inspector Praveen Gajanan Patil has registered the complaint and taken up the investigation of the case.
Pushpalata Pradip Chinderkar, 68, was sent a dubious WhatsApp link which required her to fill out her internet banking login/password and bank user ID into a form. She is a retired Union Bank employee. Chinderkar had all her provident fund savings invested into a fixed deposit. The pension and the interest earned on it are Chinderkar and her family’s primary source of sustenance.
She had some issues related to the fixed deposit so she decided to lodge a complaint online. While registering her complaint on the Union Bank grievance cell, she kept encountering an error.
Eventually, she mentioned her phone number online following which she received two calls. During the second call, she was asked to open a link sent to her WhatsApp number. Upon opening the link, the caller told her to download the app and register her complaint so that it could be referred to the bench. Chinderkar questioned the method by which she was being asked to download the app but the caller assured her it was the normal way of doing it.
“I downloaded an app which opened a form in which I filled out my internet banking login/password and bank user ID. Soon after I submitted the form, I got a message saying money has been debited from my account,” Chinderkar said in theFIR.
After she realised she was being cheated, Chinderkar immediately switched off her phone and used her husband’s mobile phone to call the Union Bank call centre to inform them about the fraud.

"The Mumbai police have recovered over Rs 1 crore of cybercrime victims since launching the helpline number 1930 in May, said Balsing Rajput, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), cyber crimes.
Speaking at a press conference, Rajput said, “We have recovered over Rs 1 crore in less than seven months after the helpline was started on May 17 this year. It is very important for the victims of financial cybercrimes to call us soon after they are cheated as it gives us that much time to block the transactions.”
However, the helpline is not 24/7. It is operational from 10 am to 6 pm and many victims who fall prey to cybercrimes after 6 pm are unable to make use of this helpline number immediately.
However, financial cybercrime victims can still save their money if they visit the website.cybercrime.gov.in, where they can give their details related to the fraud and stop transactions to save their money. The victims can also rush to their nearest police station where an official from the cybercrime unit would help them to save their money.
“We are making efforts and are hopeful to make this helpline 24/7 but we facing manpower issues at present,” said a cybercrime official.

"In a fresh operation targeting the money laundering network of Chinese loan apps, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday searched five locations in Bengaluru, including premises of payment gateway Razorpay, and seized Rs 78 crore. The agency searched various merchant IDs and bank accounts of the Chinese-controlled entities that are operating the illegal apps.
A Razorpay spokesperson said it cooperated with the agency and its funds were not seized.
The ED began the money laundering probe based on 18 FIRs registered by the Bengaluru central crime branch after multiple complaints about “extortion and harassment of those who had availed small amounts of loan through Chinese mobile apps”.
“During investigation, it has emerged that these entities are controlled/operated by Chinese nationals. These entities use forged documents of Indians to make them dummy directors and for generating proceeds of crime,” the ED said.
“It has come to the notice that the said entities were doing their suspected/illegal business through various merchant IDs/accounts held with payment gateways/banks. The premises of Razorpay Pvt Ltd and the bank’s compliance offices related to these entities were covered in the search operation. During the search operation, it was noticed that the said entities were generating proceeds of crime through various merchant IDs/accounts held with payment gateways/banks and they have submitted fake addresses in KYC documents,” the ED said on Friday.
“We would like to clarify that this recent visit by ED is as part of the ongoing investigation against a few suspicious entities who conducted illegal business through multiple payment gateways/banks. We proactively blocked all suspicious entities and funds associated with them about 1.5 years ago, and we have shared their details with the ED. Being a regulated financial institution, we routinely cooperate with law enforcement agencies. No funds of Razorpay were frozen as part of these visits. We would like to reiterate that all our operations and onboarding processes adhere to the highest standards of governance and regulatory guidelines,” said a Razorpay spokesperson.

"A woman was duped by cyber fraudsters on false assurances of employing her in a reputed private airlines company.
The woman lodged theFIRin this case at the Sangvi police station.
According to a press release issued Tuesday by the Pimpri-Chinchwad police, the complaint came in contact with the online fraudsters through a web portal in September 2020.
Since then, the woman received multiple phone calls from the fraudsters, who promised her a job in an airlines company.
As stated in the FIR, the fraudsters, including a woman, also showed an identity card of this company to the complainant to gain her trust.
Then they made her transfer Rs 11,500 into a bank account, saying it was required for her job. But the woman received no job offer.
Police have booked the unidentified cyber fraudsters in this case under sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and sections of the Information Technology Act.
Police are investigating the phone numbers used by the fraudsters to communicate with the complainant as well as the bank account into which the money was transferred by her.

"Until August this year, 3,301 FIRs for cyber crimes were registered by the Mumbai Police but in only 182 of them, i.e., 5.5 per cent cases, arrests could be made. Hemraj Singh Rajput, Deputy Commissioner of Police, cyber, speaks with Jayprakash S Naidu on the awareness needed to reduce cyber crimes, measures being taken to solve them, and hurdles faced by police while tackling the cases.
Many people lose money to cyber crime and do not know what they need to do immediately to recover their money. What should they do?
They should dial 1930 — a helpline to recover money lost to online financial crime.
The victim must have all details related to the cyber crime like the bank account details, UPI link where the money was transferred so the account could be frozen.
The helpline was started by the Mumbai Police on May 17 this year and till date, we have attended more than 11,000 calls.
Of these, 1,900 calls were for financial frauds and we managed to freeze an amount of more than Rs 40 lakh which the victims will get back. But the victim needs to call us within an hour (of the crime being committed) or as early as possible.
Do you think the helpline team needs to be expanded and its services made available round-the-clock?
Presently, 1930 helpline number functions from 10 am to 6 pm. But we are trying to make it round-the-clock so that if cybercrime happens late at night or in the wee hours, we will be able to stop the fraudulent transactions. We are working on increasing the manpower and hopefully, we will expand the team.
Many fake mobile numbers of wine shops, eateries, courier services, helpline numbers of banks etc. are uploaded onGoogleby cyber fraudsters and people end up calling on them and losing money. Are the cyber police doing anything to prevent such crimes?
We call it “edit fraud”. We are in touch with different search engines. We search for such fraudulent numbers and report them to search engines and to CERT-In on a daily basis. Even search engines are taking down these numbers on our request as well as by themselves.
I would advise the people to not assume that the numbers they find on search engines are genuine. They must visit a genuine website for the numbers.
Senior citizens often fall prey to cyber crime. How do you reach out to them to prevent such cases?
Not just senior citizens, even youngsters fall prey to cyber crime. We are doing an awareness campaign through Mumbai Police social media platforms, radio channels, media houses where we are trying to make people understand, “Jo Dikhta hai woh hota nahi hain (What you see may not be true)”.
We are making reels with the hashtag: #ThodasaSochle (Think before you act).
Further, we are organising 15 to 20 minutes of street plays to educate people on cybercrime in a humorous way.
We are working with Rotary clubs and Indian Merchants Chambers (IMC) ladies’ wing for awareness.
We are approaching schools and colleges to hold awareness campaigns. We are planning competitions with students. We are approaching senior citizen clubs too.
Tell us about the preventive measures banks, social media platforms and brands must immediately undertake to prevent cyber crime?
First, there must be vigilance. All banks and other brands must check all these search engines to find out if their names and numbers are being used by fraudsters and they should report it to the search engine, which must take them down.
Secondly, the banks and all intermediaries like matrimonial sites, search engines, brands etc. should keep the customers aware through multiple mediums including social media.
As cyber crimes are taking over conventional crimes, do you think the city police must also have 12 zonal cyber crime units?
Right now, we have five regional cyber crime police stations which will deal with cases involving amount worth over Rs 10 lakh. Every police station has a cyber cell and our plan is to strengthen the five regional cyber crime police stations. We will also strengthen cyber units at police station level.
What are the major problems you face as DCP of the cyber police in Mumbai?
In the two years of (coronavirus-induced) lockdown, cyber crime has shot up.
Even though five regional cyber crime centres have come up in Mumbai, cybercrimes too have seen a significant rise and thus, we have limited resources to face them. So, increasing manpower will be top priority. Presently, we have expertise as well as good and dedicated police officers.
It has been learnt that a new building dedicated only to cyber police will come up in Bandra. When will that happen and how will it help?
By next year, it (the building) will be handed over to Mumbai Police. Presently, we are working on plans to make best use of the building.It will have training facilities, a dedicated cyber lab which will have state-of-the-art tools, software and equipment.
All the local police stations will get all kinds of technical help from this building.

"Based on inputs from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Interpol, the Central Bureau of Investigation along with state police forces conducted searches at 105 locations across the country against “cyber-enabled financial crimes” on Tuesday.
The raids were part of CBI’s ‘Operation Chakra’ and involved police forces from six states and Union Territories – Andaman and Nicobar (searches at four locations), New Delhi (five locations),Chandigarh(three locations) and at two locations each in Punjab,Karnatakaand Assam.
“Of all the locations, CBI alone has conducted searches at around 80 locations spread across 13 states. The agency also received inputs for the raids from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,” sources said.
“From one location inRajasthan, CBI recovered Rs 1.5 crore cash and 1.5 kg gold. The accused person had been running an illegal call centre. Two such call centres were also busted inAhmedabadandPune. They were involved in call centre fraud in the US. The FBI has been informed and they are taking follow-up action,” a CBI official said.
Sources said the agency has also recovered digital evidence including details of financial transactions and cyber crime activity on the dark web. “A person of interest has also been identified in Punjab in this connection,” they added.
“This operation is being coordinated by CBI’s cyber crime division. These global operations are being galvanised by CBI’s recently launched international operations division – Cyber Crime Investigation Division,” an official said.
The raids are a part of operations that the CBI is spearheading ahead of the Interpol conference to be held in Delhi October 18 onwards.
On September 29, central agencies, state police forces along with Interpol arrested 175 people in a nationwide crackdown on drug trafficking. They had seized 45 kgs of various drugs.
The searches were conducted by the CBI, Narcotics Control Bureau and police forces of Punjab, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur andMaharashtra. After the searches, 6,600 persons were searched, 127 new cases were registered and 175 persons, including six absconding accused, were arrested. Carried under the name of “Operation Garuda”, the CBI claimed the crackdown was done in coordination with Interpol.
According to CBI, during the searches, illicit drugs including 5.125 kg (approx) heroin; 33.936 kg (approx) ganja; 3.29 kg (approx) charas; 1,365 gm (approx) Mephedrone; 33.80 gm (approx) smack; around 87 Tablets, 122 injections & 87 syringes of Buprenorphine; 946 tablets (approx) Alprazolam; 105.997 kg (approx) Tramadol; 10 gm (approx) hash oil; 0.9 gm (approx) Ecstacy pills; 1.15 kg (approx) opium; 30 kg (approx) Poppy Husk; 1.437 kg (approx) intoxicant powder & 11,039 (approx) pills/capsules, were recovered.
“The Central Bureau of Investigation has launched a multi-phase “Operation GARUDA” which seeks to disrupt, degrade and dismantle drug networks with international linkages through the rapid exchange of criminal intelligence on drug trafficking and coordinated law enforcement actions across international jurisdiction through Interpol. This global operation was initiated in close coordination with Interpol and Narcotics Control Bureau, for combating the smuggling of illicit drugs and psychotropic substances, with a special focus on Indian Ocean Region. Drug trafficking networks with international linkages require law enforcement cooperation across international jurisdiction,” the CBI said in a statement.

"A few weeks ago, while investigating two cases lodged at a police station in Ghatkopar along the eastern suburbs, the Mumbai Police’s cyber sleuths traced the suspects online to a location that had not popped up on their radar before — Ernakulam in Kerala.
One of these cases involved a gift card scam in which the complainant lost Rs 7 lakh. In the other, the complainant lost Rs 11 lakh on a fake website for investment in gold. Both the cases were lodged separately at the Pant Nagar police station. Taken together, they formed the latest dot on a cyber crime cluster map of sorts that the city’s police have been piecing together.
Investigators toldThe Indian Expressthat until the two new cases, they had traced a chunk of cyber frauds operating inMumbaito states such as Jharkhand,Rajasthan,West Bengaland Bihar, and specific locations like Noida in the National Capital Region. They now suspect that locations in Kerala could be turning into a hub of “investment scams”.
“There are groups in certain parts of the country that become adept at particular types of cons. They then stick to these cons, and the area becomes a hub,” said Hemraj Rajput, DCP (Cyber), Mumbai Police.
According to police data, scams operated through fake loan apps led to 92 cases being registered this year till August-end. The DCP said that investigators have traced “a majority of these cases” to Asansol in West Bengal and Motihari in Bihar.
“West Bengal is also the place where most cyber cons get SIM cards with which they make fake calls that cannot be tracked back to them. Loan app calls come primarily fromKarnatakanumbers and the follow-up threats are from Nepal,” Rajput said.
The data shows that 61 cases of sextortion were lodged by Mumbai Police this year till August-end, mainly from Haryana’s Mewat near the border with Rajasthan. In several such cases, fraudsters make video calls primarily to men and show a video clip of a woman undressing. They then capture videos of their target and use it to blackmail the person.
Of the 13 cases of insurance scams, where people are told that they stand to get money from a scheme — although they have not invested in one — Rajput said several originated from call centres in and around Delhi, like Noida.
Then there are electricity bill scams that have been traced to Jharkhand, he said, although the data on them is yet to be collated since the incidents are recent. These cases typically involve messages in which the victims are told they will face disconnection if they do not pay their bill instantly. The contact numbers provided in these messages lead to fraudsters.
Another senior officer overseeing cyber crime probes in Mumbai said that over the past month-and-a-half, his team visited Kerala thrice in connection with cyber crime investigations. Again, with such cases being registered mainly over the past month, the police are yet to compile data related to them.
“Our team visited one location in south Kerala and another along theTamil Nadu-Kerala border in connection with investment scams,” the officer said.
He traced the emergence of such hotspots to the fraudulent phone calls that made Jamtara in Jharkhand one of the country’s first cyber crime hubs. “Jamtara got major media attention, including a web series, thereby putting pressure on the local administration which drove out fraudsters by taking strict action. At one point, all officers at local police stations in Jamtara had been replaced,” the officer said.
“Economically, it makes sense for cyber criminals to work from hubs as more people can make use of the same infrastructure. At a lot of these places, they worked in cahoots with the local administration,” he said.
“However, once there is enough attention by law enforcement agencies and media, after a particular area constantly shows up on the radar of cyber crime investigators, there is pressure on the local administration to drive them out. Hence, you see that every few years there are new places from where cyber crimes are carried out,” the officer said.

"Last month, ESET researchers discovered a cyber espionage group known as Worok that used undisclosed tools to infiltrate a variety of high-profile companies and local governments in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.
According to ESET’s researchers, Worok has been active since 2020 and is still active today. It mainly targets telecommunications, banking, shipping, energy, military, government, and public sector companies. Several victims were compromised by the Worok hackers in late 2020.
“We believe the malware operators are after information from their victims because they focus on high-profile entities in Asia and Africa, targeting various sectors, both private and public, but with a specific emphasis on government entities,” said ESET researcher Thibaut Passilly who discovered Worok.
There was a significant break in observed operations from May 2021 to January 2022, but Worok’s activity returned in February 2022, targeting an energy company in Central Asia and a public sector entity in Southeast Asia, as per researchers.
The hacker group develops its tools and leverages existing ones to compromise its targets. The group’s custom toolset includes CLRLoad, PNGLoad, a steganography loader, as well as PowHeartBeat. These toolkits are used to reconstruct malicious payloads hidden in PNG images using a method called steganography. What this means is a PNG image is sent to a victim, which when opened compromises their system. It can perform a variety of tasks including uploading, downloading files, and even returning file metadata such as location, size, creation time, access time, and content, and delete, rename, and move files.
“While our visibility at this stage is limited, we hope that putting the spotlight on this group will encourage other researchers to share information about this group,” added Passilly.

"The trend of helpless cyber crime victims unsuccessfully running around from pillar to post trying to get their money back is witnessing a change in Mumbai, thanks to CyberSafe – a portal that the Union government had come up with to tackle cyber crime nearly three years ago.
However, the portal (www.cybersafe.gov.in), inaugurated by the Centre in collaboration with a host of fintech companies in August 2019, was hardly used by theMumbaipolice.
A training session was conducted by the cyber police on using the portal and each police station in Mumbai was provided a login ID. Ever since, some police stations have managed to save money lost by several cyber crime victims with the help of the portal.
For instance, Saki Naka resident Munna Shaikh was in Ghatkopar when he lost Rs 25,500 to a cyber criminal. He approached the local Pant Nagar police station, where a police team created an “incident ticket” on the CyberSafe portal, which can be accessed only by law enforcement agencies.
The portal is directly linked to all banks, payment gateways fromPaytm,GooglePay to Razorpay and several police forces across the country.
The incident ticket seeks details like the name of the person, the amount lost, the payment gateway used to pay the criminal and how the crime took place.
In Shaikh’s case, the cyber criminals had deposited his money in a Paytm wallet. Once the incident ticket is created on the portal, it alerts the concerned parties – in this case the Paytm customer service.
Within a few hours, the police received an email from Paytm, stating that the Rs 25,500 had been transferred to Federal Bank. It also provided the name of the fraudster’s account holder, his account number and the email ID of the nodal person at the bank.
A police constable then sent an email to the bank, attaching a notice under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (summons to produce a document as evidence), asking for a debit freeze on the account. This means that while money can be credited in the account, nobody can withdraw money.
Accordingly, before the money could be transferred anywhere else from this particular account, there was a stop on withdrawals and within three days, the Rs 25,500 was transferred to Shaikh’s account.
The seamless communication that the portal encourages allows for the money to be returned even if a person takes a few days to complain.
Prior to this, on most occasions, if Shaikh would have approached the police after three days of the incident, he would have been told that it was too late to retrieve the money. Even if the police would have tried, getting through to the nodal authorities of service providers and banks would have taken days. During this time, the money would have generally been withdrawn by cyber criminals.
In cases of cyber crimes, criminals also tend to route the money through various bank accounts to hide its trail. CyberSafe proves effective here, too, as every bank that has received the money provides details about the bank to which the money has been transferred, along with providing contact details of the nodal officer of that bank.
“Usually cyber criminals keep moving money between banks and e-wallets. With this portal, however, it is easy to track the money and contact the concerned financial institution, which replies in real time,” the officer said.
The officer added that in most cyber crime cases, the police are reluctant to register FIRs, as they know that it is difficult to arrest criminals operating from far-flung areas. Victims, too, are mostly interested in getting their money back without getting into legal issues.
“The beauty of this system is that the focus is on getting the money back first. We can later register anFIRand follow the legal process. However, on most occasions, once people get their money, they are not interested in following up,” the officer said.
In addition to real-time coordination, the portal also allows for blacklisting numbers and bank accounts used for fraudulent transactions in its “negative database”.
An officer said that recently, Mumbai Police Commissioner Vivek Phansalkar had asked all police stations to ensure they use the app. A source, however, said that the challenge here will be to ensure all police stations use the portal.
“Even now, of the over 90 police stations in the city, not more than 10-15 may be using it. Once all police stations start using it, it will make a big difference,” said an officer.
On its site, CyberSafe describes itself as an application developed jointly by FCORD – a coordination group for taking on fake currency set up by the Ministry of Home Affairs – and the private sector to make the digital payment ecosystem safe and secure, enhance the faith of the common man in the platform and assist law enforcement agencies in resolving and preventing such crimes.
FCORD, in association with several private technology partners, had developed the pilot application, CyberSafe, as an information-sharing platform between law enforcement agencies and fintech entities.
A total of 19 fintech entities and 23 police forces across the country are now linked to the portal providing real-time updates.

"Last month, ESET researchers discovered a cyber espionage group known as Worok that used undisclosed tools to infiltrate a variety of high-profile companies and local governments in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.
According to ESET’s researchers, Worok has been active since 2020 and is still active today. It mainly targets telecommunications, banking, shipping, energy, military, government, and public sector companies. Several victims were compromised by the Worok hackers in late 2020.
“We believe the malware operators are after information from their victims because they focus on high-profile entities in Asia and Africa, targeting various sectors, both private and public, but with a specific emphasis on government entities,” said ESET researcher Thibaut Passilly who discovered Worok.
There was a significant break in observed operations from May 2021 to January 2022, but Worok’s activity returned in February 2022, targeting an energy company in Central Asia and a public sector entity in Southeast Asia, as per researchers.
The hacker group develops its tools and leverages existing ones to compromise its targets. The group’s custom toolset includes CLRLoad, PNGLoad, a steganography loader, as well as PowHeartBeat. These toolkits are used to reconstruct malicious payloads hidden in PNG images using a method called steganography. What this means is a PNG image is sent to a victim, which when opened compromises their system. It can perform a variety of tasks including uploading, downloading files, and even returning file metadata such as location, size, creation time, access time, and content, and delete, rename, and move files.
“While our visibility at this stage is limited, we hope that putting the spotlight on this group will encourage other researchers to share information about this group,” added Passilly.

"The trend of helpless cyber crime victims unsuccessfully running around from pillar to post trying to get their money back is witnessing a change in Mumbai, thanks to CyberSafe – a portal that the Union government had come up with to tackle cyber crime nearly three years ago.
However, the portal (www.cybersafe.gov.in), inaugurated by the Centre in collaboration with a host of fintech companies in August 2019, was hardly used by theMumbaipolice.
A training session was conducted by the cyber police on using the portal and each police station in Mumbai was provided a login ID. Ever since, some police stations have managed to save money lost by several cyber crime victims with the help of the portal.
For instance, Saki Naka resident Munna Shaikh was in Ghatkopar when he lost Rs 25,500 to a cyber criminal. He approached the local Pant Nagar police station, where a police team created an “incident ticket” on the CyberSafe portal, which can be accessed only by law enforcement agencies.
The portal is directly linked to all banks, payment gateways fromPaytm,GooglePay to Razorpay and several police forces across the country.
The incident ticket seeks details like the name of the person, the amount lost, the payment gateway used to pay the criminal and how the crime took place.
In Shaikh’s case, the cyber criminals had deposited his money in a Paytm wallet. Once the incident ticket is created on the portal, it alerts the concerned parties – in this case the Paytm customer service.
Within a few hours, the police received an email from Paytm, stating that the Rs 25,500 had been transferred to Federal Bank. It also provided the name of the fraudster’s account holder, his account number and the email ID of the nodal person at the bank.
A police constable then sent an email to the bank, attaching a notice under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (summons to produce a document as evidence), asking for a debit freeze on the account. This means that while money can be credited in the account, nobody can withdraw money.
Accordingly, before the money could be transferred anywhere else from this particular account, there was a stop on withdrawals and within three days, the Rs 25,500 was transferred to Shaikh’s account.
The seamless communication that the portal encourages allows for the money to be returned even if a person takes a few days to complain.
Prior to this, on most occasions, if Shaikh would have approached the police after three days of the incident, he would have been told that it was too late to retrieve the money. Even if the police would have tried, getting through to the nodal authorities of service providers and banks would have taken days. During this time, the money would have generally been withdrawn by cyber criminals.
In cases of cyber crimes, criminals also tend to route the money through various bank accounts to hide its trail. CyberSafe proves effective here, too, as every bank that has received the money provides details about the bank to which the money has been transferred, along with providing contact details of the nodal officer of that bank.
“Usually cyber criminals keep moving money between banks and e-wallets. With this portal, however, it is easy to track the money and contact the concerned financial institution, which replies in real time,” the officer said.

"The Ahmedabad Cyber Crime Cell on Monday arrested two persons from Surat for allegedly stealing data of an e-commerce company for the website of their fake e-commerce company and later duping customers.
According to police, Kalpesh Vaghasia (28) and Sanket Sorathiya (24) — both residents of Kamrej inSurat, were held by a team of theAhmedabadCyber Crime Cell, after an e-commerce giant approached police stating that two dubious websites had stolen their data.
The accused had created two dubious websites —http://www.bagonia.inandhttp://www.bageto.in— where they had copied the data of online products from e-commerce companies and offered the same products at lower prices. However, customers did not receive the products after payment was done, police said.
“The complainant company approached us saying that unknown persons had registered two websites where they had stolen online data of their products… and were offering their unique products to customers at much lower price. After the customers made online payment for products, they never received it,” said a senior officer of the Ahmedabad Cyber Crime Cell.
AnFIRhas been lodged under sections of fraud and criminal breach of trust along with sections of the Information Technology (IT) Amendment Act.

"A 43-year-old man who works in the health care services in the private sector fell prey to a sextortion cyber-crime where a gang of cyber-fraudsters, including one who dressed up as a police officer on a video call, extorted Rs 7.53 lakh from him. An FIR was registered by the Nirmal Nagar police station in Khar (east), Mumbai Wednesday.
The number of sextortion cases inMumbaihas seen a significant rise this year compared to last year with the number of such cases increasing from 54 FIRs being registered in the entire last year to 47 FIRs being registered in the first six months this year.
In the latest case, the 43-year-old man told the police that he had received a friend request from a woman named Ankita Sharma on hisFacebookprofile on July 14.
He accepted the friend request and the two started chatting on Facebook messenger. The woman then made a video call and started stripping. The man cut the call after which she asked for his mobile number. He shared the number and she video-called him on Whatsapp and again stripped herself and asked him to show his face.
He then blocked her on WhatsApp and Facebook. Next day, he received a message on WhatsApp where the fraudster shared his video call recording and demanded Rs 15,000, failing which the same would be uploaded on social media platforms. The man paid the money but the fraudster asked for another Rs 15,000. He then blocked the fraudster.
Next day, the victim got a call from another person posing as a police officer from Delhi cyber police. In a video call with the victim, the man, dressed up as a police officer with a police department’s symbol in the background, told the victim that his obscene video is on YouTube and the cyber department is getting several complaints regarding it.
The fraudster gave the man the number of a person from YouTube to delete the video. When the victim contacted the number, another person posing as an executive from YouTube demanded a few lakh rupees to delete the video, to which he obliged.
Next day, the fraudster posing as police officer called back and said the woman Ankita Sharma has committed suicide and he has been made accused in the case. He demanded Rs 5 lakh to settle the matter. The victim ended up paying Rs 7.53 lakh but the scamsters kept demanding more, after which he decided to approach the police.

"A 26-year-old woman in Mumbai who tried to sell furniture worth Rs 21,000 on an online platform ended up losing Rs 3.77 lakh after a cyber fraudster tricked her into sending the money under the pretext of making her a payment.
AnFIRwas registered by the Malad police station on July 5. The woman, who works as an executive assistant in a petroleum company at Fort, lives in a building under Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA).
According to the woman, her company’s chief general manager called her saying that he wanted to sell some furniture for Rs 21,000 and he met a potential customer on Quickr, an online marketplace, who showed interest in buying them.
“The manager told the complainant that he does not use the service ofPaytmfor online transactions and hence asked her to collect the payment. He gave her the number of the person to be contacted. She agreed and contacted the person on July 3,” police said.
The person who turned out to be a cyber-fraudster sent her a QR code saying it is for payment of Rs 21,000. But when the woman scanned the code and entered her four-digit pin number, the same amount got debited from her account. The man said there was an error and using the same trick made her transfer another Rs 1,60,000 in four transactions, police said.
“The fraudster then said there was some error, and said he would contact her the next day. On July 4 he rang her up for her bank details. After sharing her bank details with the man, the stranger asked her to send Rs 500 for verification. The woman sends Rs 500 and much to her relief she gets back Rs 1,000 after which she is convinced that she will get the money back,” Malad police said.
The fraudster then asked her to send Rs 94,000 saying the entire amount along with Rs 21,000 will be returned to her. The woman kept making the transactions and ended up paying Rs 3.77 lakh, police said.
When the man asked for more money she realised she was being cheated and approached the local police.

The Haryana home department has sanctioned 21 new cyber police stations across the state, of which three have been set up in Gurgaon to handle a surge in cyber crime cases.
The three new stations – one each in South, Manesar and West zones – began functioning on Friday, said police officers. Prior to this, Gurgaon had one cyber crime police station in Sector 43, which has now been assigned for the East zone. Officials said that Gurgaon is the only district in Haryana to have four such stations.
Earlier this year, Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij had said that every police district should have at least one cyber police station to deal with rising incidents of cyber crimes.Indiwar, ACP cyber, said that all three new cyber police stations have started registration of complaints with a ‘soft launch’ on Friday.
“There has been a surge in cyber crime complaints after the pandemic. The new police stations will help in probing cyber crimes in the city. So far this year, we have received over 5000 complaints related to cyber crime and over 40 FIRs have been registered. The new cyber police stations will run awareness campaigns and sessions for people,” said the ACP.
Police said the maximum complaints of cyber crime are related to debit/credit card fraud and online/e-commerce fraud. In 2018, Haryana’s first cyber police station was launched in Gurgaon.Subhash Boken, spokesperson, Gurgaon Police, said, “The cyber police station for the western zone has been set up on the premises of Palam Vihar police station. The cyber police station for the Manesar zone will operate from IMT Sector 7 police station while the cyber police station for south zone has been set up at  sector 65 police station.”

"Emphasising the need for a pooled network of intelligence against cybercrime, police and administrative officials Friday said the state apparatus needs more helping hands to combat cybercrime.
Gujarat’s additional chief secretary in the Home Department, Rajkumar stressed the need for better training to combat instances of cyber crime in the state. “It is projected that by 2050, the digital economy will be 25 per cent of India’s economy. Everything has two aspects—good and bad. Cyber crime is the latter aspect of the digital economy. Today, one doesn’t need to launch missiles and fire tanks to bring a country down; it can be done by shutting down its banking, telecom and power supply. The futuristic threat of cyberwarfare has already arrived,” he said.
He added that while the Gujarat Police has only 1200 personnel in its cyber crime department, it is possible to create a network of over 1 lakh helping hands against the menace with the help of volunteers among citizens. “Only then can we ensure the safety and welfare of six and a half crore people of Gujarat,” the bureaucrat said.
He also spoke about the importance of cyber hygiene in net banking while addressing the personnel of state Cyber Crime Cell of CID Crime Department. “It is said that Gujarat accounts for 25 per cent of India’s market capitalisation and with the introduction of e-banking, the collective wealth of people is always under threat… Cyber hygiene can only be maintained through awareness of the risks of cybercrime and how to respond in case of any attack,” said Rajkumar.

"A 70-year-old man from Mumbai was recently extorted into paying Rs 57.50 lakh by a gang of cyber-fraudsters, who first posed as executives of a Friendship Club and engaged him into sexually explicit conversation with a woman and later posed over the phone as a police officer and extorted money from him.
AnFIRwas registered with the BKC cyber police station on June 7. The man told police that he has retired from a private job and lives alone inMumbai. He received a message on the phone on March 15. The message read, “if you need a friendship in your local area please contact this mobile number.”
The man ignored the message, but a few days later he received a phone call where a cyber-fraudster impersonating as an executive from Friendship Club offered him membership and asked him to pay Rs 3,000 in the bank account the caller provided.
The man made the payment and the next day he received a call from the fraudster who put a woman on a conference call with him. During their conversation the woman told the victim that she wants to keep “close friendship” with him. When the man asked what close friendship meant, she started talking about giving him massages and passed sexually explicit comments. The 70-year-old victim got scared and cut the phone call.
Next day, the fraudster called again and offered to put him in touch with another woman. The victim said he does not want to keep in touch with any woman and asked him to cancel his Friendship Club membership.
On March 20 another cyber-fraudster called and demanded Rs 9,000 to cancel the membership. The victim denied paying the amount and cut the phone call. On March 31, a third conman called him posing as a police sub-inspector from Nagpur police.
He told the victim, “The Friendship Club has complained against you. A woman has lodged a complaint of molestation and to settle the matter you will have to pay Rs 97,000.” In order to confirm the veracity of the caller, the victim checked the display picture on Whatsapp and Truecaller and saw a photo of a policeman in uniform and believed that he was an officer.
The victim was threatened with arrest, and under pressure he paid Rs 97,000. However, the fraudsters called him again and said he would have to pay money to cancel the membership and later as a security deposit which is refundable.
Till 19 May, the victim ended up paying Rs 57.50 lakh but the fraudster kept asking him for more money. The man told them that he does not have any more money and when the harassment continued, he approached the cyber police.
The case is registered under sections 170 (personating a public servant), 384(extortion), 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC and 67 (transmitting obscene content in electronic form) of the IT Act.
‘Delhi Police officer’ swindles Mumbai man of Rs 13 lakh
In another case, a 45-year-old Mumbai resident was cheated of nearly Rs 13 lakh after being lured into receiving obscene video calls from a woman, the police said.
The complainant, a businessman, approached the BKC cyber police station on June 7 and registered an FIR. According to the complaint, on May 6, he received a friend request onFacebookfrom a woman who asked for his mobile number and got it. They started chatting on WhatsApp and days later she made video calls to his phone. When the man attended the call, he saw that she was performing an obscene dance.
The woman then asked him to strip, which he refused and hung up, the complainant said. Soon after he received some obscene videos with his face morphed into it. The woman then began to threaten him saying she would post it on YouTube and share it with those on his Facebook friend list.
The complainant further said that before long, a man called him asking for money. He ended up paying Rs 1.94 lakh, but on June 2 another fraudster called him pretending to be an officer from the Delhi Police crime branch who was investigating a sex racket, the complaint said. The ‘officer’ informed the complainant that the woman he was acquainted with had died by suicide. The fraudster then threatened to frame him over her suicide. The complainant soon paid more money, adding up to a total of Rs 12,78,500, he revealed. When the demand for money continued, he approached the Mumbai police.
The police have registered a case under sections 170 (personating a public servant), 384 (extortion), 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC and section 67 (transmitting obscene content in electronic form) of the IT Act.

"India’s proposal before a United Nations (UN) ad-hoc committee to adopt measures similar to the controversial — and now defunct — Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000, for introducing domestic legislation in member countries to categorise “offensive messages” through “communication devices” like social media as ‘offences’, has so far failed to garner support of any nation.
Delegates from the European Union, the United Kingdom, Georgia and Luxembourg have opposed the country’s proposal for being violative of the right to speech, members attending the UN’s convention said. In 2015, the Supreme Court had struck down the particular section, calling it “unconstitutional”.

A delegation from India is currently at the second session of the UN-organised international convention on countering the use of information and communications technologies for criminal purposes in Vienna. The Indian delegation includes officials from the External Affairs, Home and IT Ministries. Set up by the terms of a UN General Assembly (UNGA) resolution approved in May 2021, the ad-hoc committee is supposed to submit a draft convention on countering cybercrime to the General Assembly’s 78th session in 2023-24. If passed, it will then be legally binding on all member nations of the committee.
One of the Indian delegation’s proposals to the committee is essentially a word-by-word copy of Section 66A of the Information Technology Act (IT Act) – the Indian delegation has essentially suggested that all member nations of the committee introduce offences in their respective domestic legislation for sending “offensive messages” through a computer resource or social media platforms.
In a landmark judgment in 2015, the Supreme Court had struck down Section 66A of the IT Act, calling it unconstitutional for “being violative of Article 19(1)(a) and not saved under Article 19(2)” of the Indian Constitution. Article 19(1)(a) gives people the right to speech and expression whereas Article 19(2) accords the state the power to impose “reasonable restrictions” on the exercise of this right. The provision was criticised for being misused by law enforcement agencies over the vagueness of what was considered to be “offensive”. However, despite the ruling, a number of instances have surfaced since where various state police departments have booked people under the now defunct provision.
Set up by the terms of a UN General Assembly (UNGA) resolution approved in May 2021, the ad-hoc committee is supposed to submit a draft convention on countering cybercrime to the General Assembly’s 78th session in 2023-24. If passed, it will then be legally binding on all member nations of the committee.
According to delegates at the committee’s ongoing convention, India’s proposal has been met with opposition by major members. The EU opposed India’s suggestion, saying that it is an “infringement on the freedom of expression and would therefore not constitute a universally recognised relevant offence for others”. On similar lines, the UK delegation said that there was not “sufficient justification” for considering the proposal that “risks infringing rights of expression”. Delegates from Georgia and Luxembourg too took a similar stance. El Salvador said that its domestic rules only apply to offensive messages which can pose a risk to children, while Nigeria said it only has civil remedies for such an offence and not criminal ones.
So far, no country has supported India’s proposal on creating offences in domestic legislation for sending “offensive messages” through a communication service – in particular, the delegation from Russia said that it needed more time to think about India’s proposal, and China did not engage with the proposal at all, according to delegates at the convention.
Queries sent to MEA, MHA and MeitY were unanswered until the time of going to press.
According to a senior government official, the Indian delegation has floated the proposal “to gauge the global consensus on the idea of penalising objectionable content on social media”. “We wanted to tell the UN convention that we used to have a law which penalised such content. The issue Section 66A ran into was of misuse. Our aim is that after deliberation among the various member nations, we can possibly reach a consensus on how the provision could be made better,” the official said on condition of anonymity.

"A Florida teenager taking a biology class at a community college got an upsetting note this year. A startup called Honorlock had flagged her as acting suspiciously during an exam in February. She was, she said in an email to The New York Times, a Black woman who had been “wrongfully accused of academic dishonesty by an algorithm.”
What happened, however, was more complicated than a simple algorithmic mistake. It involved several humans, academic bureaucracy and an automated facial detection tool from Amazon called Rekognition. Despite extensive data collection, including a recording of the girl, 17, and her screen while she took the test, the accusation of cheating was ultimately a human judgment call: Did looking away from the screen mean she was cheating?
The pandemic was a boom time for companies that remotely monitor test takers, as it became a public health hazard to gather a large group in a room. Suddenly, millions of people were forced to take bar exams, tests and quizzes alone at home on their laptops.
To prevent the temptation to cheat, and catch those who did, remote proctoring companies offered web browser extensions that detect keystrokes and cursor movements, collect audio from a computer’s microphone, and record the screen and the feed from a computer’s camera, bringing surveillance methods used by law enforcement, employers and domestic abusers into an academic setting.
Honorlock, based in Boca Raton, Florida, was founded by a couple of business school graduates who were frustrated by classmates they believed were gaming tests. The startup administered 9 million exams in 2021, charging about $5 per test or $10 per student to cover all the tests in the course. Honorlock has raised $40 million from investors, the vast majority of it since the pandemic began.
Keeping test takers honest has become a multimillion-dollar industry, but Honorlock and its competitors, including ExamSoft, ProctorU and Proctorio, have faced major blowback along the way: widespread activism, media reports on the technology’s problems and even a Senate inquiry. Some surveilled test takers have been frustrated by the software’s invasiveness, glitches, false allegations of cheating and failure to work equally well for all types of people.
The Florida teenager is a rare example of an accused cheater who received the evidence against her: a 50-second clip from her hourlong Honorlock recording. She asked that her name not be used because of the stigma associated with academic dishonesty.
The teenager was in the final year of a special program to earn both her high school diploma and her associate degree. Nearly 40 other students were in the teenager’s biology class, but they never met. The class, from Broward College, was fully remote and asynchronous.
Asynchronous online education was growing even before the pandemic. It offers students a more flexible schedule, but it has downsides. Last year, an art history student who had a question about a recorded lecture tried to email his professor, and discovered that the man had died nearly two years earlier.
The Florida teenager’s biology professor, Jonelle Orridge, was alive, but distant, her interactions with students taking place by email, as she assigned readings and YouTube videos. The exam this past February was the second the teenager had taken in the class. She set up her laptop in her living room in North Lauderdale making sure to follow a long list of rules set out in the class syllabus and in an Honorlock drop-down menu: Do not eat or drink, use a phone, have others in the room, look off screen to read notes, and so on.
The student had to pose in front of her laptop camera for a photo, show her student ID, and then pick her laptop up and use its camera to provide a 360-degree scan of the room to prove she didn’t have any contraband material. She didn’t mind any of this, she said, because she hoped the measures would prevent others from cheating.
She thought the test went well, but a few days later, she received an email from Orridge.
“You were flagged by Honorlock,” Orridge wrote. “After review of your video, you were observed frequently looking down and away from the screen before answering questions.”
She was receiving a zero on the exam, and the matter was being referred to the dean of student affairs. “If you are found responsible for academic dishonesty the grade of zero will remain,” Orridge wrote.
“This must be a mistake,” the student replied in an email. “I was not being academically dishonest. Looking down does not indicate academic dishonesty.”
‘The word of God’
The New York Times has reviewed the video. Honorlock recordings of several other students are visible briefly in the screen capture, before the teenager’s video is played.
The student and her screen are visible, as is a partial log of time stamps, including at least one red flag, which is meant to indicate highly suspicious behavior, just a minute into her test. As the student begins the exam, at 8:29 a.m., she scrolls through four questions, appearing to look down after reading each one, once for as long as 10 seconds. She shifts slightly. She does not answer any of the questions during the 50-second clip.
It’s impossible to say with certainty what is happening in the video. What the artificial intelligence technology got right is that she looked down. But to do what? She could be staring at the table, a smartphone or notes. The video is ambiguous.
When the student met with the dean and Orridge by video, she said, she told them that she looks down to think, and that she fiddles with her hands to jog her memory. They were not swayed. The student was found “responsible” for “noncompliance with directions,” resulting in a zero on the exam and a warning on her record.
“Who stares at a test the entire time they’re taking a test? That’s ridiculous. That’s not how humans work,” said Cooper Quintin, a technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights organization. “Normal behaviors are punished by this software.”
After examining online proctoring software that medical students at Dartmouth College claimed had wrongly flagged them, Quintin suggested that schools have outside experts review evidence of cheating. The most serious flaw with these systems may be a human one: educators who overreact when artificially intelligent software raises an alert.
“Schools seem to be treating it as the word of God,” Quintin said. “If the computer says you’re cheating, you must be cheating.”
Tess Mitchell, a spokeswoman for Honorlock, said it was not the company’s role to advise schools on how to deal with behavior flagged by its product.
“In no case do we definitively identify ‘cheaters’ — the final decision and course of action is up to the instructor and school, just as it would be in a classroom setting,” Mitchell said. “It can be challenging to interpret a student’s actions. That’s why we don’t.”
Orridge did not respond to requests for comment for this article. A spokeswoman from Broward College said she could not discuss the case because of student privacy laws. In an email, she said faculty “exercise their best judgment” about what they see in Honorlock reports. She said a first warning for dishonesty would appear on a student’s record but not have more serious consequences, such as preventing the student from graduating or transferring credits to another institution.
Honorlock hasn’t previously disclosed exactly how its artificial intelligence works, but a company spokeswoman revealed that the company performs face detection using Rekognition, an image analysis tool that Amazon started selling in 2016. The Rekognition software looks for facial landmarks — nose, eyes, eyebrows, mouth — and returns a confidence score that what is on screen is a face. It can also infer the emotional state, gender and angle of the face.
Honorlock will flag a test taker as suspicious if it detects multiple faces in the room, or if the test taker’s face disappears, which could happen when people cover their face with their hands in frustration, said Brandon Smith, Honorlock’s president and chief operating officer.
Honorlock does sometimes use human employees to monitor test takers; “live proctors” will pop in by chat if there is a high number of flags on an exam to find out what is going on. Recently, these proctors discovered that Rekognition was mistakenly registering faces in photos or posters as additional people in the room.
When something like that happens, Honorlock tells Amazon’s engineers. “They take our real data and use it to improve their AI,” Smith said.
Rekognition was supposed to be a step up from what Honorlock had been using. A previous face detection tool from Google was worse at detecting the faces of people with a range of skin tones, Smith said.
But Rekognition has also been accused of bias. In a series of studies, Joy Buolamwini, a computer researcher and executive director of the Algorithmic Justice League, found that gender classification software, including Rekognition, worked least well on darker-skinned females.
Determining a person’s gender is different from detecting or recognizing a face, but Buolamwini considered her findings a canary in a coal mine. “If you sell one system that has been shown to have bias on human faces, it is doubtful your other face-based products are also completely bias free,” she wrote in 2019.
The Times analyzed images from the student’s Honorlock video with Amazon Rekognition. It was 99.9% confident that a face was present and that it was sad, and 59% confident that the student was a man.
Buolamwini said the Florida student’s skin color and gender should be a consideration in her attempts to clear her name, regardless of whether they affected the algorithm’s performance.
“Whether it is technically linked to race or gender, the stigma and presumption placed on students of color can be exacerbated when a machine label feeds into confirmation bias,” Buolamwini wrote in an email.
As the pandemic winds down, and test takers can gather in person again, the remote proctoring industry may soon be in lower demand and face far less scrutiny. However, the intense activism around the technology during the pandemic did lead at least one company to make a major change to its product.
ProctorU, an Honorlock competitor, no longer offers an AI-only product that flags videos for professors to review.
“The faculty didn’t have the time, training or ability to do it or do it properly,” said Jarrod Morgan, ProctorU’s founder. A review of ProctorU’s internal data found that videos of flagged behavior were opened only 11% of the time.
All suspicious behavior is now reviewed by one of the company’s approximately 1,300 proctors, most of whom are based abroad in cheaper labor markets. Morgan said these contractors went through rigorous training, and would “confirm a breach” only if there was solid evidence that a test taker was receiving help. ProctorU administered 4 million exams last year; in analyzing 3 million of those tests, it found that over 200,000, or about 7%, involved some kind of academic misconduct, according to the company.
The teenager graduated from Broward College this month. She remains distraught at being labeled a cheater and fears it could happen again.
“I try to become like a mannequin during tests now,” she said.

AnFIRwas registered by the Sakinaka police against unknown persons on Friday. According to the complaint, on April 13, the complainant’s friend sent him an email related to a job opening. The complainant read it and sent his resume to ‘recruiter/maxiconstruction.org’ and the reply came some days later asking him to appear for a job interview’.
On April 15, the civil engineer was made to take a written test during aSkypevideo call and four days later, he received an email informing him that he had been selected for the job, the complaint stated, adding that he was asked to send his documents on email for arranging his visa for three years.
The fraudsters also gave him bank details and the mobile number of a James Moore, who they introduced as an executive assistant of the British Embassy in New Delhi, the complaint further stated. The engineer was asked to pay processing fees, verification fees and travel fees which was ‘refundable’, as well as for visa finalisation and work permit. Sensing foul play, the complainant felt suspicious and checked the procedure to get a job in the UK. Realising that he had to keep making the payments in order to get the job, he continued paying the fraudsters whenever asked to. In all, he paid Rs 9.09 lakh.
The fraudsters then sought another fee for giving him the job without further interviews while asking him to pay an additional travel fee and a fee for entering the UK, the complainant stated. This was when he realised that he had been duped and he requested the accused to return his money a number of times. However, the fraudsters then broke off communication, leaving the civic engineer with no option but to approach the police.

"Not a day goes by when the UT police does not register a case of cyber crime. Police officers say if this carries on, cyber crimes will be on top of the crime chart in Chandigarh. In the first four months of this year itself, the city police has registered 70 per cent FIRs related to cyber crimes, compared to 2021.
A look at the statistics of theChandigarhPolice’s Cyber Crime Investigation Cell (CCIC) shows a total of 5,922 complaints and 67 FIRs related to cyber crimes in 2021. A total of 2,130 complaints (which amounts to 35 per cent of the total complaints received) and 47 FIRs (70 per cent of the total FIRs lodged) have already been registered between January 1 and April 30 this year. At least 1,550 of the total 2,130 complaints received this year relate to fraudulent transactions, online transactions asking for PIN, debit/credit card details, etc. Besides these, they also received 519 complaints related to harassment, abusive calls, messages through WhatsApp, IMO, VOIP calls, etc.
“The maximum number of FIRs that we register these days relate to cyber crimes. It is one of the reasons among others behind the increasing number of cybercrime related cases. Simultaneously, there is an improvement in the detection ratio also. We are able to arrest the people involved in these cases from far reaching places. For speedy court trials of cybercrime related cases, securing the conviction of accused, meetings are going on with judicial officers at many levels. There is awareness about cyber crimes among people. But a lot to achieve yet. We need to do a lot of work at many levels if we want to make a cyber crime free city,” SP (Cyber) Ketan Bansal, said.
Chandigarh is a member of Joint Cybercrime Coordination Team (JCCT) Group-5. Other states/UTs in the JCCT Group-5 include Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Ladakh,Jammuand Kashmir. A high level meeting of the JCCT Group-5 which was attended by DGPs of many states along with the officers from the Ministry of home Affairs (MHA) took place last month in Chandigarh.
“The aim behind holding such high level meetings is to increase the efficiency and improve the coordination among the different investigation agencies. As we all know, financial frauds through online modes are the biggest threat in the present time before us. It involves many sectors including banks, Reserve Bank of India (RBI), social networking sites, etc., which require a lot of correspondence online and offline. In the meeting, we stress to follow such a mechanism through which the coordination among all the institutes becomes smooth and flexible,” a senior police officer said. There are seven JCCTs, which include all the states and UTs.
“We launched a full-fledged campaign titled Cyber Swachhata Mission in Chandigarh involving hundreds of students of computer science and related subjects as cyber interns with the CCIC. Many surveys were conducted. Modus operandi were shortlisted, reasons behind why people increasingly falling in the traps of fraudsters, solutions for cyber crimes and techniques through which shortcomings of the investigation agencies can be sorted out were shortlisted,” the Chandigarh police’s CCIC incharge, Inspector Hari Om, said.
Nobody is immune
In the two-month survey, many aspects were covered by cyber interns. The survey suggests that people of all age groups ranging from 15 to 80-years were among the victims targeted successfully and unsuccessfully by fraudsters. Interestingly, in many cases, timely information to the cyber cell about hacking, sharing of confidential details, etc., resulted in the saving money.
Sources in UT cyber cell said, “There are a number of cases when we received information within moments after the crime. We immediately urged the concerned bank management to block the account number or freeze it, so the money could not be withdrawn/ transferred. In many incidents, we were successful. The victims themselves can approach the banks.”
1930 is the centralised National Cyber Crime reporting helpline number. The number is linked with the control room of many states including Chandigarh, Punjab and Haryana.
WhenThe Indian Expressphoned the helpline number, the response was only received from the Chandigarh desk, which can be reached by dialing the extension 3. There was no response for 1 and 2, to reach the Punjab and Haryana police desks, respectively.
“The cyber criminals are outsmarts. They are ahead in technology also. Though the figures of cyber crimes have been increasing, most crimes remain un-reported due to social stigma and a reason why cyber criminals remain scot-free. Further, there is no lamination of any geographical boundaries. They operate across the world and they need not be physically present at spot. This complexity makes it harder for the LEA to completely curb this menace,” Gurcharan Singh, cyber faculty head in Central Detective Training School (CDTS), Sector 26, had told The Indian Express, in an interview last month.
Gurcharan Singh’s observation was evident from the fact when Vikas alias Vicky (23) from Fatehabad in Haryana arrested by the Chandigarh cyber cell was found linked to at least 1,352 cyber crime cases reported across the country on May 9.
Eight cell phones and four International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) numbers seized from Vikas were uploaded on the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (ICCC) portal. The portal found the numbers linked with 1,352 cyber crime cases. The ICCC is a centralised portal where the police of every state/UT upload the numbers of seized mobile sets along with their IMEI numbers. Vicky was arrested in connection with the fraud of Rs 83,979 from a woman on the pretext of refunding her money related to her SBI credit card on April 18.
Panchkula, Mohali privy too
Neighboring cities including Panchkula and Mohali are also privy to cyber crimes. According to ACP (Panchkula) Raj Kumar Kaushik, at least 100 cases in which fraudsters duped people merely on the pretext of updating their Know Your Customer (KYC) details pertaining to their bank accounts have been reported only in Panchkula.
How to avoid getting cheated
* Avoid sharing any particulars like bank account details with strangers directly or over the phone.
* If you have been cheated, immediately call the toll-free helpline 1930.
* If you do not receive a response from your bank after reporting a fraud, contact the Banking Ombudsman at RBI, Sector 17.
* Get sensitised about online banking and transactions before using online banking services.
KYC details
A common way to fraudsters obtain confidential details from people is by asking for their Know Your Customer (KYC) details, for them to be able to continue their bank accounts, credit cards, etc. As one shares their particulars, fraudsters begin online shopping. They also demand a One Time Password (OTP) which comes on the phone of the victim. RBI has cleared it multiple times that no bank is authorised to collect KYC details of customers over phone.
Dish TV recharge/ coupons/ phone bill payment
Text messages with a web link sent on the cell phones of people urging them to recharge their dish TV subscriptions, coupons, or to make payments of pending mobile bills. The link, once opened, will follow with instructions that require confidential details to be shared. It is not advisable to click these unknown weblinks.
Extortion after befriending people on social media
Many organised gangs involving women are active that target people. Many senior citizens have become victims of these gangs. A member usually befriends one, often urging them to perform obscene acts on the video calls using women’s faces. These videos are recorded and later used to blackmail and extort money.
AnyDesk link
AnyDesk, a mobile application that allows another user to see and interact with another computer system over the Internet, has been used since the onset of the pandemic, due to many organisations working from home. The link is sent on the phone of the victim urging them to click to update KYC details, pay online mobile bills, etc. UT has reported a dozen cases, where people lost lakhs, by clicking on an AnyDesk link.
Paytm, GPay QR codes
Cheating people by making payments through Paytm or GPay QR codes mostly happen in online shopping, or while making payments to strangers. People are asked to initiate a payment of Rs 10, or less, and share the QR code along with it. This establishes a link with the fraudster, who is able to hack into the the bank account linked with the code, and access the money. However, this is not the same as paying a merchant through a QR code at a shop. People are advised not to share QR codes with strangers.
Insurance schemes, investments
Many retired people are being targeted with insurance schemes. To gain the trust of victims, fraudsters transfer interest rates over the invested money into the accounts of the victims in the initial months but stop making payments when the victims invest a larger sum in the scheme. In some cases, fraudsters charge a fee if the victim wants to obtain their full amount, which will never be given.
Bitcoin scams, instant loan providing apps
Investment in low price Bitcoins is popular among youngsters. There is no immediate remedy in the Bitcoin cheating cases. Shibonk, Dogecoin and Titcoin along with two other crypto currencies are the most famous among the investors. It is easy for people to purchase these crypto currencies. A number of instant loan providing mobile applications at high interest rate are there. As one downloads the app, the contact list automatically goes to the handlers. In case when one fails to pay the money, false messages are sent to the contacts.
Theft of SIM cards, swapping of cards
SIM card of the victim is stolen and is placed in their handsets, accessing all control over online banking, etc. They change the online banking password after visiting the option ‘forget password’. The OTP also lands in their handsets. ATM/debit card swapping, mostly happen when someone does not know how to operate the machine properly. Criminals swap these on the pretext of assisting the victims.
Stealing profiles, hacking emails
Suspects create fake profiles onFacebookusing particulars of genuine people and sending messages/emails to their contacts about emergency financial help. They mention bank accounts in the messages/emails. In the recent past, many such cases were reported including profiles of serving and retired UT officers.
Job promises, air tickets, visas
Fraudsters invite applications for jobs on the fake portals which match reputed job providing portals by changing alphabets. They obtain bio-datas, send them confirmation letters of jobs in foreign countries, MNCs and charge a heavy fee.

"A SECTOR 32 resident, Manjinder Singh, was cheated of Rs 4.34 lakh minutes after he clicked a web link shared on his cell phone to update Know Your Customer (KYC) details pertaining to his savings account in State Bank of India (SBI).
The web link was shared from a mobile number which was later found registered to a fake identity. The person who called Manjinder Singh had introduced himself as a representative of SBI.
Though the incident took place in December last year, theFIRwas registered after a thorough investigation and obtaining legal opinion.
In the past week too, a UT resident was cheated under the pretext of changing his KYC details for SBI.
Sources said that a total of Rs 4,34,700 was transferred from Manjinder’s account in two different accounts in three installments.
The UT cyber cell has been probing at least nine other cases in which people were cheated as they clicked web links sent to them for updating their KYC and other particulars.
“In most of these cases, we have concluded that the shared web link is of Any Desk app, which enables another person to access/regulate the mobile phone of the victims. As the victims opened the web link, fraudsters managed to access/see their confidential details, OTPs, passwords, etc., on their screens. We have been urging people to not entertain any shared web links on their phones and trust anyone who calls and asks them to do something to merely update particulars related to their bank accounts,” a senior cyber cell officer said.
Cheating through sharing web links have emerged as one of the most adopted mechanisms by cyber criminals, during a two-month long survey conducted by cyber interns attached with UT Cyber Crime Investigation Cell (CCIC).
Other ways include luring people to provide loans under the PM Jan Dhan Yojna Scheme, customising/changing the helpline mobile number of banks, companies, wallets, etc. onGoogleby using Surveymonkey app and Google AdWords app, etc.
In the recently held 3rd Joint Cyber Crime Coordination Team (JCCT) Group-5 conference, here inChandigarh, it was noted that cyber crimes have been increasing with each passing day.
The registration of cases also increased. However, the conviction ratio remains low. Officials said that a major reason behind this is absence of better coordination between prosecutors and investigation agencies.

"A 20-year-old law student from Pune, who was searching for an education loan online, was cheated to the tune of Rs 90,000 after cyber fraudsters she contacted on a website allegedly misled her into paying the amount in multiple transfers, the police said.
On Monday evening, the student filed afirst information report(FIR) regarding the fraud at Dehu Road police station in Pimpri-Chinchwad, following which the police registered a case under the Information Technology Act and also invoked sections pertaining to cheating under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against the accused, officers said.
According to the FIR, the complainant was searching online for an education loan on the night of April 1 for completing certain academic requirements for her law degree. During the search she found a platform offering education loans and contacted the phone numbers posted on its website. The person who responded to the call said she could obtain a loan of Rs 5 lakh and asked her to send her identity documents and credentials, it said.

Subsequently, she received multiple calls from various people claiming to be from the same platform and sought transfers from her on the pretext of processing fees, security charges, taxation fees, ‘RBI interest’ and so on, the FIR added. After making half a dozen transfers, totalling over Rs 90,000, she spoke with relatives and friends who pointed out that she had been swindled, the woman said.

"The Haryana police have recently trained 345 officers of the state crime branch to intensify its fight against the growing issue of cybercrime.
Earlier, in October 2021, the cyber desks were set up in 309 police stations after observing the difficulties victims of cybercrimes faced in reporting their complaints. According to sources, efforts are being made to equip all 361 of the state’s police stations with cyber desks.
While underlining the need to report such frauds immediately to the police, Haryana Additional Director General of Police (ADGP) (crime),  OP Singh, said: “If you are an internet user, do take time out to know about ‘1930’. It is a toll-free cyber crime helpline run by the union home ministry through the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal (NCRP).”
“The NCRP provides an integrated platform where all stakeholders like law enforcement agencies, banks, financial intermediaries, payment wallets work in tandem to block the flow of money from the account of the victims to that of fraudsters”, he said.
Giving an insight on how things work, OP Singh said, “All calls made on the helpline from Haryana are received by five telephone lines at the cyber police station inPanchkula. The officers attending these calls take three actions – take all relevant details from the caller, inform the financial intermediaries through the NCRP portal to block the flow of defrauded money and finally send the complaint to the jurisdiction police station to register anFIRand carry out a criminal investigation.”
“The earlier the crime is reported, the greater is the chance of the money being recovered and the criminal being caught,” the ADGP added.
The state crime branch also has a state-of-the-art cyber forensic laboratory to provide necessary technical assistance to the investigating officers of cybercrime.
Since October 2021, all stations have registered 214 cases of cybercrime, arrested 35 offenders and recovered Rs 42.2 lakhs of online frauds.
Haryana police observe the first Wednesday of every month as Cyber Crime Awareness Day. On this day, field units organise engagement programs to make people aware of the latest modus operandi being adopted by cyber-thugs and precautions that they need to take to avoid falling prey to them.

In the last two months, some 600 teachers have been trained in the basics of cyber security with the aim that they would, in turn, sensitise children about the threats posed by online predators, OP Singh said.
The state crime branch also operates a Twitter handle with the user name @HaryanaCyber whereby “it seeks to inform people about the latest modus operandi being adopted by cybercriminals and responds to calls for help from the victims of cybercrime”.

"In the view of rising financial frauds where cyber criminals have been using innovative methods to defraud gullible individuals and newbies, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) released a 40 page booklet listing out all the ways scammers can steal your financial credentials and empty your bank accounts.
This booklet titled ‘BE(A)WARE’ emphasises the need to keep one’s personal information safe,  practicing due diligence while performing financial transactions. Here are all the popular ways RBI lists that scammers use frequently to steal your sensitive data.
Pushing out a malicious link is one of the most simple method to scam an unsolicited individual. According to RBI, fraudsters might create a fake website which looks like an existing genuine website, such as bank’s website or e-commerce website or search engine, etc. These links are then circulated by fraudsters through text messages or via social media, etc.
Malicious links are masked through authentic looking names of websites, but in reality, the customer gets redirected to phishing website. When customers enter secure credentials on these websites, the same is captured and used by the fraudsters
It should be noted that most of the time, customers enter secure credentials by just having a glance and clicking at the link but not checking the detailed URL. On e-commerce platforms, fraudsters might pretend to be buyers and show interest in your product. This is a very classic technique of  defrauding individuals.
“Instead of paying money to you, they use “request money” option through UPI app and insist to approve the request to pull money from your bank account,”RBI said in its research.
Malicious mobile apps are the easiest way for hackers to gain complete access to your device. These applications are shared as ‘authentic’ apps on social media platforms and WhatsApp group chats. The link is engineered in such a way that the customer is redirected to download unknown application. Once the app is downloaded, the fraudster gains complete access to your device.
RBI highlights that these apps are mostly screen sharing apps through which the scammers can watch , control your mobile phone to gain access to your financial credentials.  Later, they make payments using your Internet banking and payment apps.
All of us rely uponGoogleto search for contact number of businesses, banks, and government offices. Scammers are well aware that search engines have become a source of trust. Taking advantage of this, scammers have listed out fake contact details on search engines such as Google,Yahoo, etc., to attract victims and steal their money.
Once a customers calls on these number, the impostors ask the customers to give their card credentials details  for verification. Assuming this contact to be genuine, people compromise all their secure details and thus fall prey to frauds.
Scanning QR codes has become very prominent during COVID times. Whether you’re in a restaurant looking to access the menu, or want to make a contact less payment. Scammers often contact customers under various pretext and trick them into scanning QR codes using payment apps. This allows the fraudsters to withdraw money from customer’s account.
This might sound unbelievable, but scammers have figured out a way to infect your devices and gain full access to it, using a charger. RBI in its research, notes that ‘juice jacking’ is a type of cyber stealing, where, once your mobile is connected tounknown or unverified charging ports, unknown apps are installed with which, the fraudsters can steal sensitive data, email, SMS,  and even saved passwords.
RBI lists out ways to stay safe online.
#Be wary of suspicious looking pop ups that appear during your browsing session.
#Always check for a secure payment gateway (https:// – URL with a Pad Lock Symbol) before making online payments.
#Keep your PIN (Personal Identification Number), password, and credit or debit card number, CVV private.
#Avoid saving card details on websites/devices/public laptop/desktops.
#Turn on two-factor authentication where facility is available.
#Never open emails from unknown sources containing suspicious attachment or phishing links.
#Do not share copies of chequebook, KYC documents with strangers.

"With increasing number of cases of cyber crime being reported across the state, Inspector General (IG), cyber crime, Yashasvi Yadav talks to Mohamed Thaver about the need for pre-empting cyber crimes and the looming threat of cyber terrorism.
🗞️Subscribe Now: Get Express Premium to access the best Election reporting and analysis🗞️
Cyber crime has been growing at a rampant pace across the state and the country. In terms of crimes reported, how big a threat do you think cyber crime is?
Cyber crime has become the world’s biggest organised crime syndicate in 2021. Its damages are worth 6 trillion — 2.5 times the value of India’s economy. It is believed that by 2025, cyber crime damages will be worth 10 trillion dollars. Over the years, cyber crime has only grown and was especially accelerated during the pandemic.
Among the various kinds of cyber crime emerging, which ones do you see as the biggest threats?
In terms of threat level, cyber terrorism is something that we should be wary of. Railway signaling systems can be hacked and trains made to collide with each other, water purification systems can be hacked and chlorine content can be increased that could prove fatal for a large section of the population. Drone tracks are something that has already begun. Cyber terrorism is something we should guard against. Back in October 2020, there was an attack on our electricity lines leading to a power outage. I had done an inquiry in that case and we found 14 trojan horses installed, a finding that was ratified by the central agencies.
In terms of monetary crimes, what are the biggest threats?
One of the most damaging cyber crimes is ransomware attacks that target big organisations. Two weeks back, there was a ransomware attack on Jawaharlal Nehru Port Terminal (JNPT) port, which had suffered a similar attack a few years back. There was also a ransomware attack at MIDC. Apart from that, we have lost large sums in malware attacks in banks like the ones in Nanded andPunewhere they lost Rs 14 crore and Rs 96 crore respectively. Recently, there have been rising cases of e-SIM fraud where fraudsters activate e-SIM in your name and wipe out your bank account.
What measures can be taken to avoid such losses to cyber crimes?
In a nutshell, we need TRA – Training Resources and Awareness to take on cyber crime. The biggest weapon in cases of cyber crime is awareness as it is very difficult to detect cases where Virtual Private Network (VPN) is used as it makes us lose the IP address. We need resources like state-of-the-art mechanisms to counter such attacks. We are also training our own people so that they are equipped to take on such sophisticated cyber crimes. However, unlike conventional crime for which you need to train once, cyber crime is like an amoeba that is constantly changing its form. Hence, the training has to be continuous as cyber criminals keep evolving their modus operandi in a matter of weeks.

What should be the government’s approach in terms of resources provided and policy formulated against cyber crime?
Policy makers have to focus on cyber crime. We should not wait for a trigger in the form of a big attack to start developing our capabilities but be proactive and avoid any such attack from taking place. There should be proper training, attention should be given to cyber crime as the department needs resources, training and manpower. The government should fill these gaps so that we become more proactive.

"Even as law enforcement agencies across the country have struggled to find ways to deal with cyber fraudsters cheating people through phone calls and web portals, initiatives have been taken at times by individual officers, police units or at the Union government level that have provided some relief to cybercrime victims.
Some initiatives, however, that started with much bluster eventually fell through over a period of time due to lack of enthusiasm and follow up from officers.
One of the most successful methods to ensure money lost by victims was recovered was on account of the efforts of two constables from Gwalior who managed to save nearly Rs 15 crore over the last few years only with the help of a WhatsApp group.
In March 2017, constables Pushpendra Yadav and Radharaman Tripathi, attached to the state cyber police and posted in Gwalior, started the WhatsApp group named ‘Stop Banking Fraud’. Due to its growing demand, a Telegram group was also later created. The group has policemen from across the country as well as nodal authorities of major banks, payment services, e-commerce portals or aggregators.
The aim of the group is to get a real-time response from nodal agencies and aggregators, especially in the golden hour – mostly an hour or two after the crime. Once the complainant approaches the police in the golden hour, the personnel ask the nodal officers of banks, payment services, e-commerce portals or aggregators, who are present on the WhatsApp group, to stop the payment immediately.
As against the traditional means of sending an email, waiting for the right person to check it and act on it that on most occasions gets late, the WhatsApp group works at a much faster pace. Case in point is a senior citizen from Juhu who lost Rs 75,000 that he had kept aside for hiscancertreatment. A caller asked him to reveal his card details and used the money to make purchases onFlipkartlast August. The man’s daughter approached the Juhu police, which took the help of an officer from theMumbaiPolice Crime Branch, who is active on the ‘Stop Banking Fraud’ WhatsApp group.
The officer saw that the card details had been used to make purchases on Flipkart. A request in a format that has been provided by nodal agencies was put up on the WhatsApp group around 12.20 pm on August 6 by the officer. At 12.25, a Flipkart nodal officer present in the group responded to it and soon they were informed that the transactions had been stopped. Now, all it would take is an official email and the money would be returned to the senior citizen.
An initiative that was launched by the Centre last year in mid-June was to start a national helpline – 155260 – which was changed to 1930 recently, which victims of financial cyber frauds can call to try and recover their money. However, the number has not been a success inMaharashtradue to a lack of manpower.
The way it is meant to work is that on calling 1930, the victims can press ‘1’ for getting in touch with officers from Maharashtra Cyber. An officer is meant to pick up the call and get details from the victim to freeze the bank account/s where money has been transferred by the cyber fraudster. This helpline service was important for those victims who do not have access to the Internet or are unable to complete the procedure on their own.
However, whenThe Indian Expresscalled 1930 on Thursday night, no one picked up. Another call made on Friday afternoon also went unanswered.
A source in the Maharashtra Cyber department said that manpower has been an issue to run the helpline but senior officers have sent a proposal to the home department seeking an increase in manpower. A source admitted that the 1930 helpline service in Maharashtra is “active only between 10 am to 6 pm” and is not a 24/7 service, as it is meant to be.
As per information received from the department, 48,936 complaints have been received till date on the helpline and Rs 75.84 lakh have been recovered.
The Union government has also launched the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal (NCCRP – cybercrime.gov.in) where data about cybercrime can be uploaded, using which bank accounts, where money is fraudulently transferred, can be frozen.
The Mira Bhayandar Vasai Virar police, with help from actors Shreyas Talpade and Vicky Kaushal, has made YouTube videos to spread awareness on how to use the NCCR portal to recover money. It has also started a WhatsApp helpline – 900 488 0135 – where victims of financial cyber frauds can call seeking help.

“Last year, we recovered Rs 2.5 lakh in vishing frauds. This year, we recovered Rs 3.81 lakh,” said an official from the cybercrime branch of MBVV.
Former state IG (Cyber) Brijesh Singh had started an “anti-phishing” portal where victims who had lost money to cyber frauds could upload details. The victim could, for example, provide the mobile number from where the fraudulent calls were made and the bank account where their money was fraudulently transferred, among other details.
While the initiative was started in March 2019, it has seen 6,106 complaints till date. However, over the past year, the portal is not active, as officers at the cyber police station claim that as there is already a national portal for cybercrime, there is no need for this portal.

"In 2021, Mumbai Police registered an 18 per cent rise in cyber crime – a trend reflective of an increasing tribe of digital criminals who are steadily adding to their profits without getting into the risk of street violence.
WhileMumbai, like most cities across the globe, has seen a significant surge in cyber scams with the internet supplanting the real world as a hunting ground for criminals, Mumbai Police is facing the challenge of tracking these cases which, more often than not, go unreported, and in apprehending the masterminds who operate without geographic boundaries.
Recently, in the annual crime conference of the Mumbai Police, the joint commissioner of police (crime), Milind Bharambe, acknowledged that dealing with cyber crime was a “challenging issue” and spoke at length about why solving such cases was difficult. While records state that only 2,883 cybercrime cases were registered in 2021, senior officials privately agree that many more cases in which amounts involved may be smaller are not even registered at the police stations. Even the detection of the cases that were filed was pretty low — at 16 per cent with only 455 of the 2,833 cases being detected.
The low detection is largely due to the modus operandi used by the accused who operate their criminal enterprises from faraway states and cover their tracks with sophisticated software.
The most common way of swindling money is to talk gullible victims into disclosing their personal financial details and decamping with money from their bank accounts or electronic wallets using this information. Another way is a simple confidence trick whereby the fraudsters gain trust of the victims and willingly make them transfer large amounts into their accounts.
The difficulty of tracing them is largely because of the areas from which the criminal choose to operate. The earliest such hotspot was Jamtara in Jharkhand.
JCP Bharambe said, “There are several cyber hotspots on the map of the country, especially villages from where these cyber criminals operate. These areas are strategically chosen in Naxal areas, deserted or hilly terrain to ensure police forces have a difficult time reaching there.”
Some of these hotspots operate from different states such as Jharkhand,West Bengal, Bihar andRajasthan, he said. Of late, as per several reports, Mewat, Bharatpur and Mathura, which form the tri-junction of Haryana, Rajasthan and UP, is being termed as the “New Jamtara” after it was found that a majority of cyber crimes was committed from this region. It was found that the accused keep moving between these three states whenever the police go after them.
One of the first buffers the fraudsters create against arrest is by targeting victims from other states. In most cases, fraudulent calls being made in Mumbai came from Jharkhand, West Bengal, Bihar,Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana. Hunting for criminals in these places would entail the city or state police to travel to other states and take assistance from other units.
The second reason for the low detection is apathy on the part of the police who think twice before sending their teams to far-off places for the fear of incurring expenditure to recover what they deem as “miniscule amounts”. An officer said that if a person has lost around Rs 40,000-Rs 50,000, sending a team of five-six personnel behind the accused would cost more than the amount lost by the victim.
The few cases in which police teams went to far-off places and arrested the accused are those in which the amount lost is to the tune of several lakhs. Even the five new cyber police stations started in the city last year to take on this menace only take complaints for cases in which the amount lost is higher than Rs 10 lakh. Provided that most cases with a smaller sum of money involved are bound to go unsolved, police stations, too, are reluctant to “spoil their statistics” by converting complaints into FIRs.
Under these circumstances, a majority of victims have no option but to let go of the money they have lost to cyber crime.
The only scenario where a victim can recover their money is if they alert the police or the bank within an hour of the fraud being committed and ensure the transaction is reverted.

The setting up of five cyber crime police stations in the last one year has also helped in increasing the number of resolved cases. In 2021, even as the overall detection rate in cyber crime cases was 16%, it was 59% at the cyber crime police stations. “The victims in cases of cybercrimes should approach the police station within the ‘golden hour’ — within one hour of the crime taking place.
This makes it easier to block the money transfer,” former Mumbai police Commissioner Hemant Nagrale had said.
Cyber expert Ritesh Bhatia said that in order to solve the situation, there is a need for a federal agency with units in several states. “Considering these crimes take place from various hotspots in the country, there is a need for a federal agency which has units in different states. If you send a police team from Mumbai to another state every time there is a cyber fraud, the team will permanently remain there.”

"Three more people, including a retired BSF Commandant, have fallen prey to online fraudsters.
The retired BSF Commandant, Jagbir Singh Dhillon, received a web link on his cell phone, urging him to update his Know Your Customer (KYC) details to continue using his mobile service.
Sources said that when the retired officer opened the web link and shared some of the details including an OTP with a caller, Rs 4.34 lakh was debited from his bank account and transferred to three different accounts. Dhillon, a resident of Sector 35, informed his family members immediately.
He subsequently lodged a police complaint. The case is being probed by the UT cyber cell.
A similar cheating incident happened to Rahul Rawat, a resident of Sector 41. He went to Axis Bank, Sector 17 to check his father’s bank account of his father on January 28.
Sources said, “Rahul Rawat was stunned to learn that around Rs 12 lakh had been withdrawn from his father’s account without their knowledge. He lodged a complaint with the Axis Bank officials and later approached the UT cyber cell. Police have procured the details of the bank accounts to which the money was transferred from the bank account of Rahul Rawat’s father.  Certain accounts were also frozen. The police are in the process of recovering the amount.”The complainant works with a private company. He manages his father’s bank account.
Police said that a woman of Sector 3 lost Rs 1.80 lakh after applying for a job online at a website named naukri.com.

The woman had applied for the job and subsequently, a person started communicating with her through emails.He procured Rs 1.80 lakh from her through different instalments in the name of processing fees.
“Complaints of cybercrime have been increasing with each passing day. We have also increased the ratio of registration of FIRs. So far, at least 21 FIRs related to different cyber crimes, especially cheating, were registered in the last month. Withdrawing cash while sharing web links on the pretext of updating KYC details have become a common modus operandi of the fraudsters. We appeal to the general public to not entertain any of such messages, calls and not click on any web links shared by unknown numbers,” Inspector Hari Om, in charge of the cyber cell, said.

"A team from Mumbai Crime Branch’s cyber police station has left for Delhi to take custody of Niraj Bishnoi, 21, alleged creator of Bullibai app and Aumkareshwar Thakur, 26, alleged creator of Sullideals app who were recently arrested by the Delhi Police’s Special Cell. The Cyber police suspect that the three accused arrested by them for promoting the Bullibai hate app may be connected to Sullideals app as well. A senior crime branch official confirmed the development to the Indian Express.
Bishnoi, who is the main accused in the Bullibai app case, is a native of Assam. He along with his aides collected personal details and photos of 126 Muslim women and posted obscene content and auctioned them on the app. Bishnoi is a second-year engineering student of Vellore Institute of Technology,Bhopal, and was suspended from college after his arrest on January 6. Using the pseudo name “Giyu” , a Japanese gaming character, Bishnoi concealed his real identity on social media.
He interacted with the three accused – Vishal Kumar Jha,21, a second-year engineering student, Mayank Rawat, 21, a BSC student, and Shweta Singh, 18, a HSC pass out, as Giyu and they did not know his real identity. On his instructions, the three uploaded content from the app on Twitter. All accused names of Sikh community to make it look like its Sikh people who are behind the app.
Through Bishnoi, on January 9 the IFSO unit of Special cell managed to track down Aumkareshwar Thakur, a native from Indore. He has done BCA from IPS Academy, Indore. The cyber police suspect the three accused arrested by them are also linked to Thakur and hence need his custody. Bishnoi told police that he got the idea of making Bullibai deals app from Thakur. Even as aFIRwas registered against Sullideals app in August last year, the accused Thakur was never found. In December, the accused Bishnoi created the Bullibai app which led to an uproar following which the police cracked down on the accused which eventually led to Thakur’s arrest.

"THE DELHI Police on Thursday arrested a21-year-old engineering student from Assamfor allegedly creating the web-based app which hosted doctored photographs and objectionable comments targeting Muslim women.
Identifying the accused as Niraj Bishnoi, a resident ofJorhatdistrict, police said he is a second-year B.Tech. student at Vellore Institute of Technology,Bhopal. Bishnoi is alleged to be the “main conspirator and creator” of the app.
Later in the day, VIT (Bhopal) issued a notice saying that Bishnoi had been suspended.
This is the fourth arrest in the case. Earlier this week,MumbaiPolice arrested Vishal Kumar Jha, a 21-year-old engineering student, from Bengaluru, and two others — Mayank Rawat, a 21-year-old Delhi University student, and Shweta Singh, 19 — from Uttarakhand.
Theapp was hosted on US-based GitHubon December 31.Doctored photos of at least 100 Muslim women, along with lewd remarks and comments, were posted online. On January 2, separate FIRs were registered in Delhi and Mumbai, based on complaints by women who were among those targeted.
Bishnoi was picked up from his residence in Jorhat by a Delhi Police team led by DCP (Cyber Cell) K P S Malhotra. He was brought to Delhi, where he was formally arrested. He has been sent to police custody for seven days.
“We have arrested the main conspirator/ mastermind and creator of the web-based app. He was also running the main Twitter account of the app. Our team caught him in Jorhat. He has confessed to his crime,” said Malhotra.
He said Bishnoi was tracked following technical surveillance on the devices used to upload and share the objectionable content. He said “forensic remnants” of the app were recovered from Bishnoi’s device. Bishnoi also admitted that he created the app, said police.
“We have found that the other three persons (arrested by Mumbai Police) were just following Bishnoi’s instructions. They were following him on social media. He was guiding them to create accounts on Twitter,” said a source.

“We don’t think he’s involved in other cases. We are questioning him about the app and how he created it. The others accused didn’t reveal his name during questioning. We tracked him down,” said a police source. Sources said they tracked Bishnoi’s IP address during their investigations.
According to police, Bishnoi confessed that he had created the app on GitHub, and was also behind two Twitter handles @bullibai_ and @Sage0x1. “He developed the app in November and updated it again in December last year. The Twitter account was created on December 31. Another Twitter account, @Sage0x1, was used by him to tweet about the app. He was continuously monitoring the news on social media,” said Malhotra.
Police sources said Bishnoi was also the person behind the Twitter handle @giyu44, which, on Wednesday, had tweeted that the Mumbai Police had arrested “innocents”. “I am the person who created #BulliBaiApp,” he had tweeted. In a series of tweets, he had asked the Mumbai Police to “publicly apologise for arresting two innocents and defaming them”. “I will personally surrender if someone arranges for my travel by flight,” said a tweet.
On Thursday, around 6.55 pm, another tweet with a screenshot of an email was posted from the account. It said the screenshot was of a purported mail from help@github.com asking the receiver to “respond” to a government request regarding the GitHub account.
According to Delhi Police sources, Bishnoi said he was upset with some people for allegedly posting obscene, morphed pictures of Hindu women, and decided to teach them a lesson. “He first created an account, posted pictures and then asked his friends, including the three accused arrested by the Mumbai Police, to share the content on social media. He started talking with them on social media about a year ago,” said sources. Police said Bishnoi also changed his statement, giving different reasons for uploading the content.
In Assam, Superintendent of Police, Jorhat, Ankur Jain, said: “The Delhi Police contacted us about Bishnoi. They said he had created the app and morphed photos of Muslim women. We helped them and he was apprehended… Bishnoi was inRajasthanfor some time and then went to Delhi. On December 25, he came back to Assam. His laptop and phone have been seized.”
Speaking toThe Indian Expressfrom their home in Jorhat, Bishnoi’s father, who owns a grocery store, said the family was completely in the dark about what was happening. “We have no idea how this happened and are in shock. We were asleep when the police landed at around 11 pm on Wednesday,” he said, adding that he was “not aware of the website” and there had to be “some mistake” in his son’s arrest. He said Bishnoi was “good in studies, especially Computer Science” and had no “negative records” during his school years.
Bishnoi’s father hails from Rajasthan, but moved to Assam in 1986.

The Delhi Police Cyber Cell had earlier written to GitHub and Twitter, seeking details on the app creators and the Twitter handles which shared its content. Twitter asked the police to approach it via “proper channels”. Sources said a formal request was also sent.
In Delhi, a case has been registered under IPC Sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on the ground of religion and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony), 153B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration), 354A (sexual harassment) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) against unknown persons who developed the app and some Twitter handles that disseminated its content.

"Most Indians seem to have a penchant for picking simple passwords that hardly serve the purpose. A new 2021 research report byNordPass, gives us some insight into the most commonly used passwords and the time it takes to crack them.
As per the report, simple numeric passwords such as 123456, 123456789, 111111, and 12345 were widely adopted by users from around the globe, and it would reportedly take less than one second to crack the same.
Simple passwords such as qwerty, password, dragon, and money were also used commonly. The report also states that even passwords such as asdfghjkl, asdfgh, and 147258369 could be cracked in under one second.
As far as India is concerned, the most commonly used passwords are password, 12345, 123456, 123456789, 12345678, india123, 1234567890, 1234567, qwerty, abc123, iloveyou and xxx among others.
As per the report, all of these passwords can be cracked in under one minute, with the exception of india123, which would take 17 minutes to be cracked. The report sheds some light on how users around the globe and India, choose to assign simple passwords which can be cracked easily.
The report states that a wide number of people around the world use their own names as passwords. The band ‘Onedirection’ is still very popular and has made a comeback to the list of the most commonly used passwords in various countries after missing the spot in the 2020 report.
The report also signifies the popularity of the football club Liverpool, judging by the number of times it has been used as a password. As far as cars are concerned, Ferrari and Porsche are said to be very popular password choices, that are also easy to crack.
Surprisingly, a number of people around the globe also use swear words as their password of choice. Additionally, the report states that men use swear words as their go-to choice of passwords, more often than females. On the other hand, the password ‘iloveyou’ is used more by women than men in the US.
It is vital to choose a strong password to stay safe from cyberattacks which have become a real threat in this day and age. The report advises users to choose complex passwords with at least 12 characters and a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

"FIVE PERSONS including three Nigerians have been arrested from New Delhi by the cyber cell of Mumbai police for allegedly duping a 51-year-old doctor from the western suburbs to the tune of Rs 13.59 lakh.
The police said the gang had approached her through a fake profile onFacebook, where they posed as a doctor from Italy and subsequently under the pretext of sending gifts, allegedly conned her into paying the amount.
According to police officials, the incident took place between May and June.
The police said the victim received a friend request from a profile named Marco Kelvin Lucas. “As the bio read that he is a doctor from Italy, she accepted the request following which the two started chatting,” said an officer.
Later, through the fake profile, they alleged that they were sending her 85,000 Euros, watches and handbags after which one of their female accomplices reached out to her claiming that the bag containing these valuables had been seized.
“Under the pretext of paying custom duty fees, custom penalty, insurance fee and conversion procedure fee, the frauds made her pay Rs 13.59 lakh,” said deputy commissioner of police Rashmi Karandikar.
The woman had then submitted a complaint. A case was registered under relevant sections of cheating and cheating by impersonation.
“With the help of technical evidence, they managed to trace one of the culprits, identified as Pankaj Singh (24),” added Karandikar.
During the course of his interrogation, names of other culprits were identified who were also arrested from Delhi.
The police said that the four other accused arrested in the case have been identified as Chijjioke Desmond Iheka (38), Kelechi Jonathan Dike (44) Chidozie Morris (35) and Sarfaraz Ansari (35).
Following their arrest, the police seized 25 mobile phones, four laptops, one tablet (phone and 10 debit cards.

"Despite making a public announcement in January 2021 it seized 31 Bitcoins worth Rs 9 crore from a hacker arrested in November 2020, the Bengaluru police have not shown the seizure in a chargesheet filed the following month. The chargesheet related to the illegal hacking activities of the hacker Srikrishna alias Sriki, 26.
One of the primary reasons for a cloud of suspicion of corruption around cases involving the hacker — which has now become a source of concern for theBJPgovernment inKarnataka—is the disappearance of these 31 Bitcoins. The whole episode has highlighted the lack of protocols and expertise within the police in handling new age crimes involving crypto currencies and the dark net, police sources said.
According to multiple sources in Bengaluru police, the hacker tricked the police into believing he had transferred the Bitcoins (claimed to have been acquired by hacking three Bitcoin exchanges) to a police wallet for seizure.
The Bengaluru Central Crime Branch police had obtained permission from the state Chief Secretary to create an e-wallet and use experts from the Indian Institute of Science to oversee the seizure. It, however, found later that the hacker falsely claimed possession of Bitcoins that were actually located in a bitcoin exchange online into which he had gained some access, police sources said.
Following his arrest in November 2020 – in a case of buying drugs on the dark net with Bitcoins – the police had announced the seizure of 31 stolen Bitcoins worth Rs nine crore – the largest Bitcoin seizure in a crime in Bengaluru.
In January 2021 when Union Home Minister Amit Shah visited Bengaluru to launch a slew of police projects in Karnataka, the police held an exhibition to showcase the arrest of Srikrishna alias Sriki. A statement at the exhibition with Sriki’s picture said he had “hacked 3 Bitcoin exchanges and 10 poker websites. Bengaluru police have so far seized Rs 9 crore worth of bitcoins from him”.
The charge sheet filed on February 22 only shows seizure ofAppleMacbooks, iphones and other computer devices belonging to the hacker and four of his associates. Police sources said no seizures of Bitcoins had been shown because Srikrishna had tricked crime branch officials into believing he was going to transfer Bitcoins in his possession to a police wallet.
“He showed us the presence of 31 Bitcoins. He provided a primary password on a site and showed the presence of 31 Bitcoins. Based on this disclosure, a seizure procedure was initiated. When we looked at the wallet again, there were over 180 coins and we realised he was falsely claiming possession of coins in a Bitcoin exchange,” a police source said.
A senior police officer said the Karnataka police does not have any stipulated procedural guidelines for seizure of crypto currencies if they are found in the course of crime investigations. “Ideally, a physical wallet – not connected to the Internet – should be used to carry out seizures of Bitcoins in the possession of the accused. This can prevent rigging of e-wallets,” the officer said.
According to a private cyber crime expert who occasionally works with the police in most cases, as many as six confirmatory passwords are required for transfer of crypto currency from one wallet to another while the minimum number of authorisations is three.
One of the issues in the case of Srikrishna was that his knowledge of computer systems and hacking was much higher than that of police officials and others which led to the police being easily misled, the sources said. “The seizure of the Bitcoins was done in the presence of the hacker himself. The police should have seized it independently with experts,” said another police source.
In a statement to the police after his arrest in November 2020, Srikrishna claimed to have been involved in the hacking of three international Bitcoin exchanges – Bitfinex, BTC-e.com and Mpex – to gain access to over 5,000 bitcoins (now worth over $300 million) and several poker gaming sites to rig poker games in favour of his associates or to extort the companies.
Police sources said the public announcements of the seizures of 31 bitcoins worth Rs nine crore were made in the case against Srikrishna before the seizures were properly confirmed.
The disappearance of the 31 Bitcoins claimed to have been seized by the police and hacker’s claim of stealing over 5,000 Bitcoins through the hacking of Bitcoin exchanges has raised suspicion of corruption in the handling of the international hacker’s case. The opposition Congress in Karnataka has questioned the BJP government over the disappearance of Bitcoins in the case.
“In chargesheet filed by CCB police, it is recorded that the accused looted 5,000 bitcoins through unethical hacking. Who holds these bitcoins now? Have they got it transferred to accounts of investigating agencies? Or are they clueless?” Congress leaderSiddaramaiahsaid on social media a few days ago.

"A SENIOR citizen who was employed with a central government service was cheated of Rs 1.14 crore by cyber criminals earlier this week. The fraudsters asked him to pay Rs 4.5 lakh to gain access to his insurance money but ended up defrauding him, police said.
The complainant, S Prasad, a Trombay resident, approached the East Region cyber police on Tuesday. AnFIRhas been registered against nine people who the police suspect are from outside the state.
According to the police, Prasad received a call on Monday from a person who claimed to be from the Central Government Employees Group Insurance Scheme (CGEGIS).
The caller told Prasad that if he made a payment of Rs 4.5 lakh, he could withdraw the amount accumulated over the years during his employment, police said. Prasad made the payment, after which he was contacted by several other people, who asked him to make more payments under various pretexts. He eventually paid Rs 1.14 crore to the fraudsters before realising he had been duped.
A senior officer said the FIR was registered against nine people who spoke to the complainant using names like Anjali Verma, SN Mahapatra, Ravindra Das and Rakesh Malhotra, among others. “We suspect all of these are fake names,” the officer added.
An officer investigating the case said the calls to the complainant were likely made from another state.  The officer said, “A disturbing trend in such cases is how the accused manage to get access to the database of government services. In this case, how would the suspects know the complainant had a CGEGIS account without access to it?”

"To tackle the challenges associated with the investigation and prosecution in cyber crime cases, the Gandhinagar-based National Forensic Sciences University (NFSU) has trained hundreds of law officers, IPS probationary officers and police officers from foreign countries.
According to NSUI officials, 104 IPS probationary officers of different state cadres and several police officers from Maldives, Bhutan and Nepal underwent a week-long training at the NFSU campus from August 13 to August 18. Additionally, around 250 law officers of the Gujarat government were trained on cyber crimes and law awareness.
The law officers, including public prosecutors and government pleaders, were trained in Indian Penal Code and Information Technology (IT) Amendment Act sections, while the police officers were trained on the increasing use of dark net and cryptocurrency for criminal activities, including drug smuggling and terror funding.

Dark net that falls under the blanket domain of “deep web”, the portion of the internet that is not accessible by conventional search engines such asGoogleandYahoo, requires encrypted servers, making it difficult for law agencies to keep track.
Speaking toThe Indian Express, an NFSU official said, “The topics covered for IPS probationary officers were emerging trend in multimedia forensics, dark net case studies, psychological techniques of investigation, Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropics Substances (NDPS) field level detection, cryptocurrency case studies, mobile forensics, social media challenges, crime scene management, mobile investigation and forensic kits.”
“Additionally, we conducted a five-week training for polygraph testing for the Maldives police officers,” the official added. The NFSU also started its training session for law officers of the state government for a module on “Cyber Crime and Cyber Law Awareness”.
“We have 250 law officers who will be trained in the subject. There are four batches and we conducted a two-day training for the first batch of 63 public prosecutors on August 23,” the official added.
Termed as an “institute of national importance” by an Act of Parliament, NFSUGandhinagarwas founded with the intent to meet the acute demand for forensic experts in India and the world.

"Two years after Rs 11.5 crore was stolen from the Karnataka government’s e-governance centre by a hacker, investigators are yet to account for nearly Rs six crore of the stolen funds siphoned to bank accounts in Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, using an elaborate network
Although an investigation of the theft by the cybercrime unit of the CID police inKarnatakahas resulted in the naming of as many as 20 accused persons in the case, the probe has also found that many individuals linked to the stolen funds were probably unaware of the source of the money when large deposits were made into their bank accounts by the main suspects.
A money laundering investigation of the stolen funds by the directorate of enforcement (ED) recently resulted in theprovisional attachment of Rs 1.44 crorethat was lying in 14 bank accounts linked to M/s Nimmi Enterprises, a firm inUttar Pradesh’s Bulandshahr, where a sum of Rs 1.05 crore was found to have been illegally transferred when the cyberheist was first discovered in August 2019.
“A major portion of the stolen funds – nearly Rs six crore – is still not recovered. Some of the accused are believed to have received the stolen money in cash in the elaborate layering process in which the money was stolen and utilized,” a senior police officer said.

The main accused in the hacking of the e-procurement cell at Karnataka’s centre for e-governance is a 25-year-old hacker Srikrishna Ramesh alias Sriki – whose computer hacking skills were allegedly used by affluent gangs he has been a part of in Bengaluru, including close associates and kin of political leaders in the state to carry out online attacks and thefts.
The police have identified a gang comprising the son of a doctor, a law student, two sons of a former bank director among those who used the services of Srikrishna to hack the e-procurement cell’s funds, which are Earnest Money Deposits (EDM) made by bidders, in the month of July 2019.
The gang, initially, placed the stolen funds in the bank account of an NGO Uday Grama Vikash Sanstha in Nagpur and a private trading firm Nimmi Enterprises in Bulandshahr, before moving the funds to various other accounts in smaller sums – disguised as payments for non-existent services rendered to the NGO and Nimmi Enterprises, a CID and ED probe has found.
The hacking was first discovered on July 30, 2019, by a financial consultant with the e-procurement cell while checking the approved list of EMD refunds. The consultant found that an unauthorized instruction was issued for the unique registration number used by the Karnataka government for online banking to transfer Rs 7.37 crore as an EMD payment despite the state government not approving the refund. The transfer of the Rs 7.37 crore funds was stopped by the state e-procurement cell before it could be executed.
However, further analysis of the approved list of EMD fund transfers by the e-procurement cell revealed that on July 1, 2019, unauthorized instructions were issued for the transfer of Rs.1.05 crores of EMD funds from the e-procurement cell to the account of a firm Nimmi Enterprises in UP.
A police complaint was initially lodged on August 7, 2019, by the financial consultant S K Shailaja over the missing Rs 1.05 crore of EMD funds.
A few days later it was discovered that another “unauthorized EMD refund instruction” of Rs 10.50 crores was issued on July 9, 2019, where the funds were fraudulently transferred to an ICICI bank account of an NGO, Udaya Grama Vikas Samstha, in Nagpur. This discovery of the cyber theft of Rs 10.50 crores was reported to the police by the state officials on August 25, 2019.
The investigations by the cybercrime unit of the Karnataka CID police initially focussed on the computer forensics of how the accounts of the e-procurement cell were hacked and the money trail of the persons to whom the stolen money was transferred. “The forensic analysis revealed the possible role of the hacker Srikrishna in the early part of the probe,” police sources said.
“During the investigation of the case the flow of proceeds of the crime was analysed and accounts of main beneficiaries and secondary beneficiaries were identified, verified and the respective banks were instructed to freeze beneficiary accounts,” state prosecutors in the case have stated in court.
Among those who have been named in the case so far – apart from the hacker Srikrishna and nearly eight members of the Bengaluru gang he was associated with – is Rathnakar Valke, the secretary of the Udaya Grama Vikas Samstha NGO in Nagpur, his wife who was treasurer of the NGO, and two of his associates Randhir Ashar and Nitin Pundalik from Nagpur, who allegedly asked the NGO official to create the bank accounts where the Rs 10.5 crore stolen funds was transferred by the hackers. Ashar and Pundalik were reportedly procurement agents for the Udaya Grama Vikasa Samstha.
The CID probe found that Rs Two crore of the Rs 10.5 crore deposited with an ICICI bank account of the NGO was transferred to the account of Rajkumar Sanklecha, the proprietor of aMumbaifirm Vardhaman Wires and Cable. Sanklecha argued during anticipatory bail hearings that he only received a payment from the NGO for supplying electrical cables and that he was not aware of the source of the funds transferred to him. An amount of Rs 40 lakh of the stolen funds was also found to have been transferred to the account of a New Delhi businessman Sushil Chandra.
At least eight persons linked to the hacking gang in Bengaluru are alleged to have carried the stolen funds in cash from various places, after the layering of the funds, to deliver it to the main accused.
“Uday Grama Vikash Sanstha, Nagpur layered the received funds into the bank accounts of various vendors/traders in the guise of business transactions i.e. without actual purchase/sale of goods by their NGO. Similarly, M/s. Nimmi Enterprises, Bulandshahar, Uttar Pradesh layered the received funds into the bank accounts of various vendors/persons in the guise of business transactions and personal loans,” the ED said this month after attaching Rs 1.44 crore linked to the cyberheist.
“During the money-laundering investigation, it is revealed that a hacker namely Srikrishna alias Sriki had hacked the portal of Centre for E-Governance, Government of Karnataka and funds to the tune of Rs 10.5 Crore and Rs 1.05 Crore were diverted to bank accounts of NGO, M/s. Uday Grama Vikash Sanstha, Nagpur and Proprietorship, M/s. Nimmi Enterprises, Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh respectively,” the ED statement said.
The cybercrime unit of the CID police is still investigating the case and is yet to file a chargesheet. The ED also continues to investigate the case.

"Barely a fortnight ago, the daughter of a senior citizen in Mumbai’s Juhu rushed to the police: online fraudsters had looted Rs 75,000 from her father after convincing him to share his credit card details over phone. He had kept aside the money for his cancer treatment. And before the card could be blocked, the fraudsters had gone on an online shopping spree.
The police turned to the Crime Branch. And the Crime Branch turned to “Stop Banking Fraud”, a WhatsApp group started four years ago by two constables in Gwalior. What happened in the next five minutes is what this unique initiative by constables Pushpendra Yadav and Radharaman Tripathi is all about.
Responding to an official request posted on the group by a Crime Branch officer, a representative of the e-commerce site stopped the transactions. Now, all the police had to do was send an email for the money to be returned.
“Saving people’s hard-earned money from cyber criminals becomes a passion after a point,” says Yadav. “We have added officers from Kashmir to Kanyakumari to the group.”
Says Gwalior Cyber Crime SP Sudhir Agarwal: “The group was formed by the two constables from the cyber department nearly four years ago. It has helped us ensure that money lost to cyber crimes can be retrieved. Now, a web portal on similar lines has been started by the Ministry of Home Affairs.”
The constables estimate that the initiative — on WhatsApp and later Telegram — has helped recover at least Rs 15 crore.
“In cases of cyber crime, stopping the money at the right time is important. All the other formalities can be done later. And this group plays a vital part in bridging the gap when it comes to stopping fraudulent payments in time,” says a senior police officer inMumbai.

According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), cyber crimes for 2019 — the last available year for which data were released — rose to 44,546 cases from 27,248 registered a year earlier. Less than one in five cases were detected, as per the data.
“Even in cases of detection, where the accused are arrested, getting the money lost is a challenging task due to the layers of bank accounts used to channel it,” says the senior officer.
The “Stop Banking Fraud” WhatsApp and Telegram groups link officers from police forces across the country, and nodal representatives of 75 service providers and five major payment aggregators. Currently, the WhatsApp group has 256 members, and the Telegram group 2,231 members.
The aim is to get real-time feedback and action from nodal agencies and aggregators, especially in the “golden hour” — the first hour or two after the crime. Before these groups came into play, the traditional method was for police to send an email, and wait for the appropriate authority at the e-company to verify and take action.
For the two constables, it all started in March 2017 when aman, who had lost Rs 40000 to a fraud, cycled to the cyber station in Gwalior. With erratic power supply, the police could not send an email to the payment site where the money had been transferred. Yadav and Tripathi then called up the representative on the landline but were asked to send a message with details of the fraud. And yet, by the next day, Rs 32,000 had been saved.
“We thought that if we were able to save money in this way, we could help many more victims. With that thought, we started the WhatsApp group,” says Yadav.
It was not easy. Of the 20 members they added initially, only five stayed back. But the two constables did not give up. They started convincing officers, and representatives of online services, e-commerce sites and cash aggregators, to sign up. Once they were able to track and save more money, more people started joining in.
But for Yadav and Tripathi, it’s still those individual cases that give them the most satisfaction.
“Recently, a man lost Rs 1.2 lakh…money he had borrowed to arrange for his daughter’s wedding. He came to us and said he would commit suicide if the wedding was called off. The money had been used to make transactions on an e-commerce site. We quickly contacted the company on the group and within 20 minutes, Rs 1 lakh was saved,” Yadav says.
“The victim started crying and hugged me so hard that I couldn’t breathe. This sense of relief is what gives us satisfaction.”

"The Delhi Police Special Cell has registered an FIR against unidentified persons in connection with creating a fake website of the UAE embassy in India and taking money from people on the pretext of providing them special approval for their return to the UAE.
The cyber cell has registered anFIRunder IPC Sections 419 (forgery), 420 (cheating) and Sections 66 (c) and 66(d) of the Information Technology Act after they received a complaint from Nisha, who is undersecretary (Gulf division) in Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) employee.
“In her complaint, she told the police that they have received a note from the UAE embassy in which they have raised concerns about some miscreants, who had duped Indian citizens on the pretext of providing approval for entry in the UAE. They have created a fake website of the embassy, using fake email id of the UAE Ambassador’s office and also a number on WhatsApp,” a senior police officer said.
On July 28, the UAE embassy in New Delhi tweeted from their official handle, “Fake website of UAE Embassy in India blocked afterCOVID-19travel scam.”
The UAE embassy came to know about the fraud after they received several complaints and the complainant has also attached all the complaints with her complaint to the police. “During the investigation, police found that the fraudsters were using the fake website with a name ofhttp://www.uaeembassy.in. However, the original link ishttps://www.mofaic.gov.ae/en/missions/new-delhi. Whenever people started searching for the UAE Embassy onGooglefrom India, the link of the fake website was the first one that pops up and they started communicating with the user,” an officer said.

"President Joe Biden emerged from a Situation Room meeting with his top cybersecurity advisers on Wednesday to declare that he “will deliver” a response to President Vladimir Putin of Russia for the wave of ransomware attacks on US companies, after hearing a series of options about how he could disrupt the extortion efforts.
Biden’s vague statement, delivered as he was departing for a trip, left it unclear whether he was planning another verbal warning to Putin similar to the one he issued three weeks ago during a one-on-one summit in Geneva or would move ahead with more aggressive options to dismantle the infrastructure used by Russian-language criminal groups.
Each option runs significant risk, because Russia is capable of escalating its own behavior. And as theransomwaredeluge has shown, many companies in the private sector and federal and state government agencies remain rife with vulnerabilities that Russian actors can find and exploit.
After more than three decades in government, Biden seems comparatively less concerned about hacking operations focused on espionage, activity that all countries conduct and that the United States carries out every day against its geopolitical rivals. But he has been alarmed by the economic disruption of ransomware, especially since gasoline, jet fuel and diesel shortages gripped the East Coast after a ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline two months ago.
Read|Major ransomware attack against US tech provider forces Swedish store closures
Attacks using ransomware, a form of malware that encrypts data until the victim pays, have grown increasingly disruptive and costly.
The White House’s argument is that the attacks are emanating from Russian territory, so it is Putin’s responsibility to take them down and that the United States will act if he does not.
Biden’s aides provided few details of the Wednesday morning meeting, which included key leaders from the State Department, the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security, and other members of the intelligence community. But they said it focused on immediate options not the longer-term policy for dealing with ransomware that is expected in the coming weeks.
Biden is under growing pressure to take some kind of visible action perhaps a strike on the Russian servers or banks that keep them running after delivering several stark warnings to Moscow that he would respond to cyberattacks on the United States with what he has called “in-kind” action against Russia. The president’s most recent warning came right after the meeting with Putin at a lakeside estate on the edges of Geneva, where Biden gave him the Department of Homeland Security’s list of 16 areas of “critical infrastructure” that the United States considers off limits and would merit a response if attacked.
The most recent attack, over the July 4 holiday, was mounted by a Russian-language group that calls itself REvil, an abbreviation of “ransomware evil.” The immediate victim was a Florida company, Kaseya, that provides software to companies that manage technology for thousands of smaller firms, which largely do not have the technology or people to manage their own systems. By getting into Kaseya’s supply chain of software, REvil was able to hold up to 1,500 companies hostage, including grocery chains, pharmacies and even railways in Sweden.
In the United States, the municipal government of North Beach, Maryland, and several small companies were affected, but Biden’s aides said the larger effects were relatively muted.
“We got lucky,” one senior official involved in cyberdefense said, noting that the ransomware group appeared to have borrowed some techniques from the Russian intelligence agency that last year manipulated the software code sold by a company called SolarWinds that maintained broad access to government and corporate networks.
A preliminary review by administration officials determined that the ransomware attack over the weekend did not affect the kind of critical infrastructure power grids, water distribution systems, the working of the internet itself that Biden had warned Putin would mark a red line.
Biden said late Wednesday that he was awaiting a report from the FBI about whether the Republican National Committee was deliberately targeted last week when one of its contractors was hit by a cyberattack that appeared to be the work of the SVR, the most skilled intelligence-gathering operation in Russia.
“The FBI is working with the RNC to determine the facts,” Biden said. “When we find out the facts, I'll know what I am going to do tomorrow.”
(RNC officials said the access was quickly cut off and nothing was stolen.)
Read|Kaseya, a software provider, investigates potential cyberattack
But it was the sophisticated nature of the Kaseya attack that concerned experts. It used a “zero day” an unknown flaw in Kaseya’s technology then spread the ransomware to the company’s clients and hundreds of their customers. Those techniques are considered unusually sophisticated for cybercriminals and help thwart traditional defenses, like the antivirus software that runs on most commercial networks and individual computers.
For months, the National Security Council has been weighing options to stop the ransomware that has debilitated gas pipelines, meat processing plants, hospitals and schools. A task force at the Justice Department, in concert with the FBI, has been working to prevent ransomware operators from getting access to some of the cryptocurrency wallets where ransoms are deposited, or moved. Last year, US Cyber Command, which runs cyberoperations for the military, disabled the servers for another Russian-language group that the United States feared Moscow might use to interfere in the 2020 presidential election.
Any combination of those techniques could be used again. Dmitry Alperovitch, a founder of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, and now the founder of the Silverado Policy Accelerator think tank, has argued that until Biden moves to cut significantly into Russia’s oil revenue, he will not get Putin’s attention.
But so far, those steps have proved insufficient to deter further attacks. The question for the White House now is whether REvil’s recent attacks come close enough to the red line set by Biden in Geneva that he cannot let the moment pass, even if the damage to US interests was limited.
“If it did, we need to follow through, and we have not been great at following through in the past,” said Chris Painter, who served in the State Department as the top diplomat negotiating rules of the road for cyberspace with other nations.
“We can’t set a red line and just not do anything about it when we’re breached continuously,” he said. “I don’t think we can afford to just sit there and wait for the next attack to happen and the next attack after that, because clearly they are not stopping.”
Whenever counterstrikes are debated in the White House, veterans of those debates note, an air of caution eventually settles in. The United States may possess what Biden calls “significant cybercapability” made clear more than a decade ago when, as vice president, he participated in the meetings on the Stuxnet cyberattacks on Iran’s nuclear centrifuges. But it is also more vulnerable to cyberattacks than most nations because it is so digitized and most of its critical infrastructure is owned by businesses that have not adequately invested in their digital defense. Thus, any escalation risks blowback.
In recent days, however, a growing number of experts have argued that the United States is now facing such a barrage of attacks that it needs to strike back more forcefully, even if it cannot control the response.
“You don’t want escalation to get out of control, but we can’t be so afraid of that that we bind our own hands,” Painter said.
William Evanina, who recently left a top counterintelligence post in the US government and now advises companies, said he would advise Biden “to be bold.”
“We need to give Putin something to think about,” he said. “And while I know people in the government like the idea of having ‘unseen’ cyberoperations, we have to show the American people and the private sector that we are doing something about this.”
Putin has denied that many of the attacks have come from Russia and has argued that the United States, with its cyberoperations around the globe, is the most active disruptive force on the internet.
But clearly a large number of the ransomware demands come out of Russia, and the ransomware code is often written to avoid hitting Russian-speaking targets.
If Moscow wanted to stop Russia’s cybercriminals from hacking American targets, experts say, it would. That is why, some Russia experts argue, the United States needs take aim at Russia’s kleptocracy, either by leaking details of Putin’s financials or by freezing oligarchs’ bank accounts.

“The only language that Putin understands is power, and his power is his money,” said Garry Kasparov, the Russian chess grandmaster and a Putin critic. “It’s not about tanks; it’s about banks. The US should wipe out oligarchs’ accounts, one by one, until the message is delivered.”
For now, REvil has shown no sign that it is diminishing operations.
In recent days, its cybercriminals continued to hijack US companies’ networks. On Wednesday, REvil hit a new target: a Florida defense contractor, HX5, that sells space and weapon launch technology to the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and NASA.
REvil posted hacked documents to its naming-and-shaming website, “The Happy Blog.” None appeared to be of vital consequence, but HX5 is just the latest contractor to be hit.

With a combined population of 30,000, these villages are located around 15 km apart and fall in the Punahana Assembly constituency in Mewat region, considered to be one of the most backward in Haryana.
The sudden spike in Jamtara-style cyber frauds during the Covid lockdowns, and subsequent investigations leading police to suspects from these villages is what brought them into spotlight.
“These two villages and their neighbouring areas in Mewat are emerging as Haryana’s own Jamtara. Majority of the youngsters in these villages are jobless and involved in the cases of cyber frauds. A major cyber crime fraud network operates with involvement of suspects from these two villages and neighbouring areas. We suspect that this gang that operates from these two villages is involved in majority of the cases of cyber frauds that are under investigation, currently in Faridabad and other districts as well. In fact, the accused during their questioning have even said that 95 per cent of their village youth are into these cyber frauds,” a senior Haryana Police officer toldThe Indian Express.
According to the officer, “The 412 complaints that are under investigation, with high probability of suspects belonging to these villages, were registered from January, 2020 till last month. Out of these, several have been converted into FIRs in which the accused belonging to these villages have been arrested. These cases are pending trial in the court, while the other complaints are also being investigated.”
ACP Anil Yadav, Faridabad, told The Indian Express, “Nai and Jamalgarh are the epicentre. Majority of youngsters of these two villages are involved in nothing else, but cyber frauds. Many of these are barely Class 5 or 6 pass. They use multiple modus operandis to cheat their targets. For instance, they identify their targets from social media portals, send them FB requests, take numbers fromJustDial, befriend their targets and then dupe them of their money. They send links of various gaming apps to their targets that once downloaded can be used to siphon off money from the downloader’s bank account. Everybody’s percentage in the gang is fixed. Be it the man who arranges fake SIM card, the shopkeeper who provides the SIM card, the person who gets bank accounts opened on fake SIM cards, the person who will make the phone call, the person who will withdraw the money etc. Throughout the day, they keep sitting in jungle areas of their villages and keep doing this only. When we go to raid their places, entire village gangs up and start levelling allegations.”
He added: “With no legitimate source of income, these criminals have constructed multi-storey houses and their entire lifestyle reeks ofthe money that they possess and spend.”
Police investigations further revealed that the gang had collected crores of rupees during Covid lockdown period through cyber frauds.
“While probing a cyber fraud complaint, we found that Jamalgarh residents Shahid, Azad and Irshad, and their associate Aslam had collected approximately Rs 6 crore during Covid lockdown period. Shahid used to send the links to the people whom this gang would target and finally take out the money from their accounts. In Shahid’s bank account Rs 20 lakh was collected in month of September, 2020 alone by cheating people. Similarly, accused Aslam had collected Rs 2-5 crore using POS machines and distributed among the gang’s members.
Irshad used to arrange fake SIM cards that were being used to commit the crime,” revealed another senior police official involved withthe investigation.
Police records revealed that on July 7, 2020, while investigating aFIRregistered by Faridabad police, they found that one accused, Mubarik, had collected over Rs 1 crore through cyber frauds.
“There were Rs 20 lakh in his bank account during Covid lockdown. Further investigations revealed that he had already collected Rs 80 lakh through same cyber frauds and distributed the same money among his accomplices,” a senior police official added.
Talking about the modus operandi adopted by the accused, another official added, “Accused Mustafa’s responsibility was to prepare forgedAadhaarcards and procure mobile phone SIM cards that were used to cheat people. They used to call people, procure their bank account details and other related information and then misuse that to withdraw money. Another accused Haidar, who was arrested subsequently, had already collected over Rs 88 lakh from various people and distributed among his accomplices”.
Imdad, a former Sarpanch of Jamalgarh told The Indian Express, “There are bunch of youngsters who are jobless and involved in such cases of frauds. A few are in police custody, while many are still at large. Jamalgarh is a big village and there could be a few who are involved in such cases. In fact, people from Nai village are more involved in such cases of frauds than Jamalgarh natives.”
Mohd Ilyas, Congress MLA (Punahana), told The Indian Express that illiteracy was a major factor behind youth of villages in the region turning to crime.
He said: “It is known that youth of these villages are involved in many such cases, but illiteracy is a major factor that is responsible. Although government and people like me, who are elected representatives, are trying our best to convince youngsters to take path of education, they are not inclined. Poverty is one aspect, but illiteracy is a major factor responsible for more and more youngsters getting into the world of crime.”
Meanwhile, the list of those duped from the gang operating from these parts keeps getting longer.
Sharing her story with The Indian Express, Monika Balla, a resident of Faridabad, said: “It was in September, 2020 when I got cheated by this gang. They took out Rs 1.2 lakh from my account. I am a make-up artist. The caller identified himself as Shrikant Fauji, engaged me for Rs 40,000 for his sister’s make-up who he said was getting married. He said he was transferring money and sent me a link, asked me to accept it. I did that, no money came. He kept changing the amount from Rs 10,000, Rs 20,000, Rs 40,000 and did not let me even check my account balance. He convinced me that it was due to my delay in accepting the link that he was sending that I was not getting the money.
Eventually, when I disconnected, I had lost my money. Police have arrested a few of these criminals, but the main culprit is still at large. In fact, even after I got the FIR registered, I have received calls from six different numbers with the same story, again attempting to cheat me.”
Sonu, a resident of Tilpat in Faridabad, got duped of Rs 80,000, allegedly by the same gang.

“A man identified himself as my old friend and told me that he was getting some money transferred in my bank account. A link came on my phone. I accepted it and the money was gone. Later, I found from my bank that many other people also have fallen victim to the similar frauds and complained with the police,” he said.
“Sonu’s case was the one probing which the team of Faridabad police had intercepted six youngsters, including a Jamalgarh resident Junaid who died 12 days after police questioned him,” ACP Yadav said.
Subsequently, a dozen police personnel of Faridabad district police were booked on charges of murder with FIR registered at Nuh’s Bichor police station on the complaint lodged by Junaid’s mother Khatija.

"Just weeks before the ransomware gang known as DarkSide attacked the owner of a major US pipeline, disrupting gasoline and jet fuel deliveries up and down the East Coast of the United States, the group was turning the screws on a small, family-owned publisher based in the Midwest.
Working with a hacker who went by the name of Woris, DarkSide launched a series of attacks meant to shut down the websites of the publisher, which works mainly with clients in primary school education, if it refused to meet a $1.75 million ransom demand. It even threatened to contact the company’s clients to falsely warn them that it had obtained information the gang said could be used by pedophiles to make fake identification cards that would allow them to enter schools.
Woris thought this last ploy was a particularly nice touch. “I laughed to the depth of my soul about the leaked IDs possibly being used by pedophiles to enter the school,” he said in Russian in a secret chat with DarkSide obtained by The New York Times. “I didn’t think it would scare them that much.”
DarkSide’s attack on the pipeline owner, Georgia-based Colonial Pipeline, did not just thrust the gang onto the international stage. It also cast a spotlight on a rapidly expanding criminal industry based primarily in Russia that has morphed from a specialty demanding highly sophisticated hacking skills into a conveyor-beltlike process. Now even small-time criminal syndicates and hackers with mediocre computer capabilities can pose a potential national security threat.
Where once criminals had to play psychological games to trick people into handing over bank passwords and have the technical know-how to siphon money out of secure personal accounts, now virtually anyone can obtain ransomware off the shelf and load it into a compromised computer system using tricks picked up from YouTube tutorials or with the help of groups like DarkSide.
“Any doofus can be a cybercriminal now,” said Sergei Pavlovich, a former hacker who served 10 years in prison in his native Belarus for cybercrimes. “The intellectual barrier to entry has gotten extremely low.”
A glimpse into DarkSide’s secret communications in the months leading up to the Colonial Pipeline attack reveals a criminal operation on the rise, pulling in millions of dollars in ransom payments each month.
DarkSide offers what is known as “ransomware as a service,” in which a malware developer charges a user fee to so-called affiliates like Woris, who may not have the technical skills to actually create ransomware but are still capable of breaking into a victim’s computer systems.
DarkSide’s services include providing technical support for hackers, negotiating with targets like the publishing company, processing payments, and devising tailored pressure campaigns through blackmail and other means, such as secondary hacks to crash websites. DarkSide’s user fees operated on a sliding scale: 25% for any ransoms less than $500,000 down to 10% for ransoms over $5 million, according to the computer security firm, FireEye.
As a startup operation, DarkSide had to contend with growing pains, it appears. In the chat with someone from the group’s customer support, Woris complained that the gang’s ransomware platform was difficult to use, costing him time and money as he worked with DarkSide to extort cash from the U.S. publishing company.
“I don’t even understand how to conduct business on your platform,” he complained in an exchange sometime in March. “We’re spending so much time when there are things to do. I understand that you don’t give a crap. If not us, others will bring you payment. It’s quantity not quality.”
The Times gained access to the internal “dashboard” that DarkSide customers used to organize and carry out ransom attacks. The login information was provided to the Times by a cybercriminal through an intermediary. The Times is withholding the name of the company involved in the attack to avoid additional reprisals from the hackers.
Access to the DarkSide dashboard offered an extraordinary glimpse into the internal workings of a Russian-speaking gang that has become the face of global cybercrime. Cast in stark black and white, the dashboard gave users access to DarkSide’s list of targets as well as a running ticker of profits and a connection to the group’s customer support staff, with whom affiliates could craft strategies for squeezing their victims.
The dashboard was still operational as of May 20, when a Times reporter logged in, even though DarkSide had released a statement a week earlier saying it was shutting down. A customer support employee responded almost immediately to a chat request sent from Woris’ account by the Times reporter. But when the reporter identified himself as a journalist, the account was immediately blocked.
Even before the attack on Colonial Pipeline, DarkSide’s business was booming. According to the cybersecurity firm Elliptic, which has studied DarkSide’s Bitcoin wallets, the gang has received about $15.5 million in Bitcoin since October 2020, with another $75 million going to affiliates.
The serious profits for such a young criminal gang — DarkSide was established only last August, according to computer security researchers — underscore how the Russian-language cybercriminal underground has mushroomed in recent years. That growth has been abetted by the rise of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin that have made the need for old-school money mules, who sometimes had to smuggle cash across borders physically, practically obsolete.
In just a couple of years, cybersecurity experts say, ransomware has developed into a tightly organized, highly compartmentalized business. There are certain hackers who break into computer systems and others whose job is to take control of them. There are tech support specialists and experts in money laundering. Many criminal gangs even have official spokespeople who do media relations and outreach.
In many ways, the organizational structure of the Russian ransomware industry mimics franchises, like McDonald’s or Hertz, that lower barriers to entry and allow for easy duplication of proven business practices and techniques. Access to DarkSide’s dashboard was all that was needed to set up shop as an affiliate of DarkSide and, if desired, download a working version of the ransomware used in the attack on Colonial Pipeline.
While the Times did not acquire that software, the publishing company offered a window into what it was like to be the victim of an attack by DarkSide ransomware.
The first thing the victim sees on the screen is a ransom letter with instructions and gentle threats.
“Welcome to DarkSide,” the letter says in English, before explaining that the victim’s computers and servers had been encrypted and any backups deleted.
To decrypt the information, victims are directed to a website where they must enter a special pass key. The letter makes clear that they can call on a tech support team if they should run into any problems.
“!!! DANGER !!! DO NOT MODIFY or try to RECOVER any files yourself,” the letter says. “We WILL NOT be able to RESTORE them.”
The DarkSide software not only locks victims’ computer systems, it also steals proprietary data, allowing affiliates to demand payment not only for unlocking the systems but also for refraining from releasing sensitive company information publicly.
In the chat log viewed by the Times, a DarkSide customer support employee boasted to Woris that he had been involved in more than 300 ransom attacks and tried to put him at ease.
“We’re just as interested in the proceeds as you are,” the employee said.
Together, they hatched the plan to put the squeeze on the publishing company, a nearly century-old, family-owned business with only a few hundred employees.
In addition to shutting down the company’s computer systems and issuing the pedophile threat, Woris’ and DarkSide’s technical support drafted a blackmail letter to be sent to school officials and parents who were the company’s clients.
“Dear school staff and parent,” the letter went, “have nothing personal against you, it is only business.” (A spokesperson for the company said that no clients were ever contacted by DarkSide, but several employees were.)
On top of this, using a new service that DarkSide introduced in April, they planned to shut down the company’s websites with so-called DDOS attacks, in which hackers overload a company’s network with fake requests.
Negotiations over the ransom with DarkSide lasted for 22 days and were carried out over email or on the gang’s blog with a hacker or hackers who spoke only in mangled English, said the company’s spokesperson. Negotiations broke down sometime in March over the company’s refusal to pay the $1.75 million ransom. DarkSide, it seems, was livid and threatened to leak news of the ransomware attack to the news media.
“Ignoring is very bad strategy for you. You don’t have much time,” DarkSide wrote in an email. “After two days we will make you blog post public and send this news for all big mass media. And everyone will see you catastrophic data leak.”
For all the strong-arm tactics, DarkSide was not completely without a moral compass. In a list of rules posted to the dashboard, the group said any attacks against educational, medical or government targets were forbidden.
In its communications, DarkSide tried to be polite, and the group expected the same of the hackers using its services. The group, after all, “very much treasures our reputation,” DarkSide said in one internal communication.
“Offending or being rude to targets for no reason is prohibited,” DarkSide said. “We aim to make money through normal and calm dialogue.”
Another important rule adopted by DarkSide, along with most other Russian-speaking cybercriminal groups, underscores a reality about modern-day cybercrime. Anyone living in the Commonwealth of Independent States, a collection of former Soviet republics, is strictly off-limits to attacks.
Cybersecurity experts say the “don’t work in .ru” stricture, a reference to Russia’s national domain suffix, has become de rigueur in the Russian-speaking hacking community to avoid entanglements with Russian law enforcement. Russian authorities have made it clear they will rarely prosecute cybercriminals for ransomware attacks and other cybercrimes outside Russia.
As a result, Russia has become a global hub for ransomware attacks, experts say. The cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, based outside Boston, tracks about 25 ransomware groups, of which about 15 — including the five biggest — are believed to be based in Russia or elsewhere in the former Soviet Union, said a threat intelligence expert for the firm, Dmitry Smilyanets.
Smilyanets is himself a former hacker from Russia who spent four years in federal custody for cybercrimes. Russia in particular has become a “greenhouse” for cybercriminals, he said.
“An atmosphere was created in Russia in which cybercriminals felt great and could thrive,” Smilyanets said. “When someone is comfortable and confident that he won’t be arrested the next day, he starts to act more freely and more brazenly.”
Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has made the rules perfectly clear. When American journalist Megyn Kelly pressed him in a 2018 interview on why Russia was not arresting hackers believed to have interfered in the U.S. election, he shot back that there was nothing to arrest them for.
“If they did not break Russian law, there is nothing to prosecute them for in Russia,” Putin said. “You must finally realize that people in Russia live by Russian laws, not by American ones.”
After the Colonial attack, PresidentJoe Bidensaid that intelligence officials had evidence the hackers were from Russia but that they had yet to find any links to the government.
“So far there is no evidence based on, from our intelligence people, that Russia is involved, though there is evidence that the actors, ransomware, is in Russia,” he said, adding that Russian authorities “have some responsibility to deal with this.”
This month, DarkSide’s support staff scrambled to respond to parts of the system being shut down, which the group attributed, without evidence, to pressure from the United States. In a posting May 8, the day after the Colonial attack became public, DarkSide staff appeared to be hoping for some sympathy from their affiliates.
“There is now the option to leave a tip for Support under ‘payments,’” the posting said. “It’s optional, but Support would be happy :).”
Days after the FBI publicly identified DarkSide as the culprit, Woris, who had yet to extract payment from the publishing company, reached out to customer service, apparently concerned.
“Hi, how’s it going,” he wrote. “They hit you hard.”
It was the last communication Woris had with DarkSide.
Days later, a message popped up on the dashboard saying the group was not exactly shutting down, as it had said it would, but selling its infrastructure so other hackers could carry on the lucrative ransomware business.
“The price is negotiable,” DarkSide wrote. “By fully launching an analogous partnership program it’s possible to make profits of $5 million a month.”

"A Mumbai-based electronic surveillance start-up recently fell victim to an alleged ransomware attack.
Police said the company’s confidential surveillance data, which was in their computer system, had been hacked and encrypted, and that the hackers were demanding Rs 2.19 crore for its release. The hackers had also threatened to sell the data on the black market if the company did not pay up, police added.
The company has lodged a complaint at Rabale MIDC police station, on the basis of which anFIRhas been filed and probe is on.
According to the FIR, the company has a office in NaviMumbaiand, at present, due toCovid-19lockdown, staff is working from home.

On May 17, around noon, the complainant, a staffer with the company, received a call from the firm’s IT engineer stating that something was wrong with the server system and data had been encrypted and was inaccessible, the FIR states.
“We have registered an FIR under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and IT Act for extortion and hacking. It looks like the company’s server was hacked from outside the country and our probe is on to get the internet protocol address,” a police officer said.

"Hackers who targeted hospitals in New Zealand's Waikato district have released what appears to be private patient information to media outlets, as health systems struggled to come back online more than a week after the attack.
A group claiming responsibility for the Waikato District Health Board cyberattack that took place last week released scores of official looking records and documents containing names, phone numbers, and addresses of patients and staff, Radio New Zealand and other local media reported.
The media outlets decided not to report the details and referred the email to the police. The outage of the health systems in Waikato continues, disrupting the treatment of patients and the payroll process of staff members.
The hospitals have now moved to manual processes to support a backlog of patients while the public was asked to look for alternative avenues for treatment for non-critical conditions.

The breach comes after Ireland's health service operator was hit by a ransomware attack that was executed by international cyber criminals.
But it was not clear if the attack in New Zealand was by the same group.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation said this week that the cyber criminals who hit the Irish health system used a malicious software dubbed ""Conti"", had targeted at least 16 U.S. medical and first response networks in the past year.
New Zealand's stock market was hit by a cyber attack last year and the central bank's data systems were also breached in an attack on a file sharing service provided by California-based Accellion.

"The cyber police station of Pune Police claimed to have helped a teacher get back Rs 2.4 lakh lost to online fraud while checking details of Covid-19 RT-PCR test on the internet.
A press release issued by the police on Friday stated that a teacher from Baner wanted to go to Delhi fromPuneby air, and then further onto Ladakh.
According to police, to get information regardingCovid-19RT-PCR test for the journey, the teacher started searched for contact numbers of an aviation company and called a number listed on the internet. The person who spoke to the teacher over the phone asked him to fill up an online form and pay Rs 10 as registration charges, police said.
Police said the teacher was also asked to download ‘AnyDesk’ and ‘SMS Forwarder’ applications on his mobile phone and, according to instructions, the teacher submitted his details online and also paid Rs 10 as registration fee.
Within some time, however, Rs 2.4 lakh was transferred from his bank account through online transactions using his credit card and debit card information, without his consent, police said.
The teacher then rushed to the cyber police station, following which nodal officers of four “payment merchants” were contacted, asking them to stop the fraudulent transactions from the teacher’s bank account, police said. The “payment merchants” responded quickly and Rs 2.4 lakh was transferred back to the teacher’s bank account, police added.
The press release stated that in the last one week, the cyber police station team, led by senior inspector D S Hake, took immediate steps due to which Rs 8 lakh were credited back to different bank accounts. The cases included that of a software engineer from Dhanori, who got Rs 1.93 lakh back; a businessman from Kothrud who got Rs 1.5 lakh back; and a senior citizen from Bibvewadi, who got Rs 93,000 back.
Also, the release further stated that a person also got back Rs 1.25 lakh lost in an “OTP fraud”.

Call the cops in ‘golden hours’
The cyber police station has asked people to approach the police during the “golden hours”, which means immediately after the fraud has taken place.

According to police, Sanjay Sumra (28), a resident of Bhavna-gar, and Dharmesh Gohil (25), a resident of Amreli, were arrested by a team ofAhmedabadCyber Crime Cell after the Knowledge Consortium of Gujarat submitted a complaint stating that a large number of students have been duped in the name of a fake government scheme of free laptops. No such scheme is currently operational by the Gujarat government, said the police.
“We had received a complaint that a fake website was made by an unknown accused where a gateway link for payment via razorpay was also mentioned. The website had mentioned that the Gujarat government had launc-hed a scheme of free laptop and free tablet for students who just passed class 12 and entered first year of undergraduate college. The website had demanded Rs 500 for registration and as many as 71 students had registered paying a total of Rs 35,500,” said an officer of Ahmedabad Cyber Crime Cell.
“Upon technical analysis, we were able to ascertain the location of the two accused and apprehend them. They told us during questioning that they had learnt to make a website and put a gateway payment link on YouTube and had come up with the idea,” said the officer.

"Securing employee endpoint devices, including laptops and smartphones, will be critical in 2021 as more and more companies will continue work from home, according to Check Point Software Technologies Ltd, a cybersecurity solutions provider.
Check Point notes that around three-quarters of organisations it has surveyed plan to transition employees to work remotely permanently, and do not expect them to return to pre-COVID operations. What this also means is that these employees could be more prone than ever to cyber attacks and companies will need to ensure security for their devices.
Around 97% of organisations in 2020 were a victim of mobile threats that used multiple attack vectors. According to Check Point’s 2021 Mobile Security Report, 46 per cent of enterprises had at least one employee who downloaded a malicious mobile app.
Cyber-criminals are aware of employees working remotely having to rely on mobile devices more than ever, and they are actively targeting enterprises with new attacks.
As more people are working remotely, they seem to be more prone to cyber-attacks. In 2020, hackers conducted thread hijacking attacks on remote workers to steal data or infiltrate networks using the Emotet and Qbot trojans, which impacted 24% of organisations globally. Attacks against remote access systems also increased sharply.
One thing to note is that outdated devices may be more at risk for these kinds of attacks. The vulnerabilities recently discovered in theMicrosoftExchange server give an insight into how critical it is for enterprises to update their softwares regularly to protect themselves against attacks that exploit flaws.
As more and more employees are working from home remotely, this makes this more challenging than ever before. According to Check Point’s Achilles research, at least 40 per cent of the world’s mobile devices are inherently vulnerable to cyberattacks due to flaws in their chipsets.

"A complaint has been lodged against unknown persons Saturday for creating a fake Twitter account with the name of IPS officer and Ahmedabad Zone 7 Deputy Commissioner of Police, Premsukh Delu, and his photograph, police said. Some controversial messages were also put out from the handle.
According to the police, anFIRwas lodged at Satellite police station under sections of the Information Technology (Amendment) Act after Delu submitted a complaint stating a Twitter account — @premsukhdeluips — had been created by an imposter using his name and photograph.
“The IPS officer concerned was told by various sources on Friday night that a fake account has been operating under his name and on Saturday the account had posted tweets that can hurt religious and social feelings. In that regard, an FIR has been lodged and further probe is being carried,” a statement issued by theAhmedabadpolice read.
One of the tweets posted by the alleged fake account of Delu on Saturday read, “Those who used to give membership ofBharatiya Janata Partywith one missed call are today unable to give bed and oxygen even after 100s of calls (sic)”.
A few other tweets from the fake Twitter handle read: “Those purchasing MLAs should try purchasing oxygen, ventilators and ambulances also (sic)”, “You have chosen him for his craft for genocide, then why are you upset when the city is full of corpses (sic).”

When contacted, Delu confirmed that the account under his name was fake and he had also requested the micro-blogging site to remove it in the past as well.
An official of Ahmedabad Cyber Crime Cell said, “Several fake accounts in the name of the IPS officer concerned had been operating on Twitter for the last few months. In March, the Ahmedabad Cyber Crime Cell had written to Twitter and shut down four such imposter accounts. This is the fifth such account and we have asked Twitter to shut it down as well.”

"Three swindlers, comprising two illiterate brothers and one class 6 dropout arrested from Jamtara, a cyber crime hub in Jharkhand, have made palatial houses and acquired unaccounted properties, a police officer said Tuesday.
The police officer said that a detailed communication attaching the pictures of the properties, including the under-construction and constructed houses of the accused, were shared with Jamtara district administration seeking a report on the source of these properties of three accused.
Two brothers, Shabudeen Ansari, 35, Sarif Ansari, 26, and their associate, Talib Ansari, 28, were arrested from two villages in Jamtara district on April 9. It is for the first time when theChandigarhPolice managed to arrest the culprits involved in a cyber fraud of Rs 11.93 lakh from Jamtara. They were remanded in judicial custody Monday.
Cyber cell Inspector Devinder Singh said, “We were stunned to see the palatial houses of the accused, who are illiterate and have no major source of income at their villages. Two of the accused have remote control-operated entry gates installed at their houses. They were arrested in connection with cheating of Rs 11.93 lakh. They disclosed that they spend the entire money on different things, including house construction. Preliminary investigation suggests that they are also involved in other cheating cases reported in other parts of India. We sent a communication to the revenue department of Jamtara district in Jharkhand to access their property details with the source of their income.”
A source said, “Whenever the Ansari brothers managed to cheat someone and transferred the money from the accounts of victims to their proxy bank accounts, they withdrew the amount by transferring the money in the account of Talib Ansari, who charged 25 per cent of each payment as his commission. Talib Ansari runs a confectionery shop at his house in the nearby village of Ansari brothers. The network of informers of these swindlers is so extensive that whenever the informers spot a strange person, cops, vehicles of outer states, swindlers are alerted. At least on three occasions, we found only elderly citizens at the houses of the accused.”
A team of Inspector Devinder Singh, ASI Rajesh, Head Constable Bahadur Lal, constable Rajinder and Sunit Kumar had visited Jamtara four times to arrest the three culprits.
A police officer said, “In such cases, it is very difficult to recover the cheated money. We are in the process to find out a mechanism to seize the properties of accused made through the cheated money. It is the reason we asked Jamtara administration to provide the details about the source of properties of the accused.” A swipe machine, three mobile phones, aPaytmdebit card and a DTH connection were recovered from the accused.

The three swindlers were arrested following a complaint of Sunita Dewan of Sector 23 who reported to the police that she was not receiving SMS alerts after withdrawing money, following which she searched the customer care number of PNB onGooglein December 2020. Considering the calls to be genuine, the victim shared the details of her ATM card, PIN and OTP received on her mobile phone. She later found that a sum of Rs 11.93 lakh was transferred from her bank account.

"The Bengaluru city police are set to launch a new Cybercrime Incident Report (CIR) system soon to focus mainly on financial fraud.
According to Bengaluru city police, financial fraud victims can launch a complaint by calling 112 and the case will be registered by cops as a Cybercrime Incident Report (CIR) and transferred to cyber crime officials in the CIR control room. The cops will then work with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to freeze the beneficiary’s account within the golden period of two hours.
Kamal Pant, Bengaluru Police Commissioner said this system is the first in the country and a people-friendly system where the victims will get immediate relief from cyber crime cases, especially financial fraud.
According to the senior police official, the Cybercrime Incident Report system, much like filing anFIR, is an information-based Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) mechanism being built for the police by a tech firm.
“The system will alert banks and internet services within around two hours, the golden period, to block a transaction or a social media account reported to be linked to a cyber offence,” said Pant.
“As per the prevailing rules, it is mandatory that you come and file a complaint in the police station and you have to sign the FIR. What we are proposing is that wherever a person is located and gets an intimation of an illegal financial transaction, then he can intimate us in real-time,” he added.
“The control room officials will soon alert the nodal officers of concerned banks and service providers. The basic purpose would be to stop further transactions because we have a two hour period to block and reverse transactions with banks. This is the basic objective,” the Bengaluru police commissioner added.
In the last few months, the Bengaluru Police is working with banks to bring them on board for rolling out the cyber crime information system.

"The Ahmedabad Police Cyber Crime Cell has been on a wild goose chase for the past eight months even as a private school in the city received yet another threatening email from an anonymous person, asking school authorities to shut online classes.
From September 9, 2020 to March 2021, the city based private school management has received a series of threatening emails from a single email address wherein the sender has threatened to upload morphed pictures of the school’s girl students on the internet if their demands are not met.
Initially, on September 9, 2020, the anonymous user had sent three letters on email demanding to cancel the mid-term examinations in the wake of which school management had cancelled the mid-term exams of classes 8 to 12.
Then on December 6 and December 9, 2020, the school received more threat emails where the sender demanded announcement of cancellation of prelim exam for Classes 10, 11 and 12.Top News Right Now68 murdered in Maliana, all accused acquitted 36 years later, residents ask: So who killed our families?In appeal, Rahul says was mistreated, sentenced to attract disqualificationKalakshetra suspends 4 teachers, appoints independent committee to probe sexual harassment allegationsClick here for more
The Indian Expresshas now learnt that the school management received yet another email a fortnight ago where the sender has demanded to cancel the ongoing online classes for the students.
The school management recently reached out to parents stating that the school “continues to receive threatening emails from an anonymous sender”, that could “defame” the school and “harm the dignity” of the students and parents.
While the school management had approached the cyber crime cell back in October 2020, the police have been unable to find any leads in the case.
Sources in theAhmedabadCyber Crime cell said that the sender who was initially specific to their demands in threat mails, has now resorted to “bullying” in order to harass the school and its students.
Police sources said that to send all the threat emails, the anonymous sender has used a network similar of Virtual Private Network (VPN) similar to a TOR (The Onion Ring) browser, an open source software which is used for sending information anonymously, a phenomenon also known as use of “dark web”.
An official with the Ahmedabad Cyber Crime Cell said, “The school management had contacted us a fortnight ago with the fresh email sent by the anonymous person. We have dedicated cyber experts, forensic crime experts to crack the case but so far no lead has been achieved.”

"A DAY after Maharashtra Chief Secretary Sitaram Kunte submitted a report to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on the phone taps carried out by police last year purportedly to investigate the alleged corruption in the transfer of IPS officers, the Mumbai crime branch’s cyber department on Friday registered a case against unidentified persons to find out how the secret inquiry report was leaked earlier this week.
The case was registered on the complaint of the state intelligence department, which had carried out the phone taps while it was being headed by IPS officer Rashmi Shukla. On Thursday, Kunte in his report to the chief minister said Shukla would be investigated for the leak.
The seven-page report of the investigation, signed by Shukla and marked “top secret”, was circulated widely on WhatsApp. Former Chief MinisterDevendra Fadnavisalso claimed to have the call recordings, which contained summary of conversations among those whose phones were tapped.
The report contained the names of several political leaders, including Home Minister Anil Deshmukh, NCP chief Sharad Pawar and Thackeray, among others. It also contained the names of several IPS and state cadre officers who, according to Shukla’s letter, were purportedly in touch with those placed under surveillance for allegedly fixing their transfers.
According to the report, as Commissioner (Intelligence), Shukla had taken permission for her action from then DGP Subodh Jaiswal. She in the report said, “The reason for surveillance was to curtail the commitment of criminal offence (s) and prevent the possible breach of trust.”
Kunte’s report said, “Prima facie, it was found that she deliberately misled and took permission under the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885,” whose “provisions were misused for a different purpose”.
It added that the leak of Shukla’s report earlier this week “seems prima facie … a copy from Shukla’s office. It is suspected that she may have leaked (it). The matter was leaked despite the fact that the letter was top-secret and it is a serious matter. If the suspicion is proved, she will be subject to severe action”.Top News Right Now68 murdered in Maliana, all accused acquitted 36 years later, residents ask: So who killed our families?In appeal, Rahul says was mistreated, sentenced to attract disqualificationKalakshetra suspends 4 teachers, appoints independent committee to probe sexual harassment allegationsClick here for more
Subsequently, a case was registered under Sections 30 of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, 43 (B) and 66 of the Information Technology Act, 2008, and Section 5 of the Official Secrets Act, 1923. An assistant commissioner of police from the cyber department is conducting the probe.
Fadnavis said the registration of the case had been done under political pressure. “I know the chief secretary very well. He is a straightforward officer. It is evident from the contents that (his) report (to the chief minister) was made by ministersNawab Malikand Jitendra Awhad and Kunte signed it and presented it to the chief minister.”
He added the report is misleading to suit the state government, and that “it is full of fallacies”.

"THE VADODARA Cyber Crime has begun a probe into a complaint from the MS University after a “fake circular” advising “single girls” to “get at least one boyfriend” or they would not be given entry into the college for “security purposes” went viral on social media platforms Sunday.
According to officials, the said letter, a screenshot of which was posted on social media sites and was shared several times, carried the letterhead of MSU and was dated January 28. It said: “It is hereby informed to all the colleges that after date 7th February, it is mandatory for all girls to have at least one boyfriend for security purpose. Single girl will not be allowed to enter into college premises. They will have to show evidence that they have a boyfriend before attending any classes. Spread Love.”
The letter is not signed but carries a reference number under the head of “Instructions”, police said.
Dr Krishnakumar Chudasma, the registrar of MSU, toldThe Indian Expressthat MSU has approached the cyber crime police to trace the origin of the said viral post.
“We learnt about the letter Sunday morning, when some of our students brought it to our notice after spotting it on various social media platforms. It is evidently a prank and students could tell that. We immediately contacted the police and asked them to initiate a probe. What is unfortunate is that despite being such a clear case of mischief, many people still forwarded the message and made it go viral. It shows how people do not exercise any caution before spreading fake news,” Chudasma said.

MSU has also clarified that it has not issued any such circular asking single girl students to produce evidence of having a “boyfriend” in order to be able to attend classes.

"The scannable shortcut we almost bid farewell to, has made a dramatic comeback, all thanks to the global pandemic. Yes, you guessed right – I’m talking about QR code.Social distancingguidelines and trends like ‘contactless-everything’ have popularised the pixelated mosaics and their slick, simple use only makes their case stronger. From being introduced in the 1990s to simply track product inventory, their versatile use has brought them a long way – from scannable restaurant menus, to customer engagement with brands, and even faster airport check-ins.
Perhaps, their widest use is in the contactless payment ecosystem – ‘Scan the QR code below and pay’. A QR (Quick Response) code is a two-dimensional barcode which is easily read by smartphones – all you need is a camera and an app to read the code.
All that’s great, but here’s where my concern begins – they may be pretty simple to generate, but identifying what’s hidden in them, is the hard part. While they have emerged as a convenient way to promote contactless technology, users lack the necessary knowledge on how to spot a fraudulent one.
While over-the-counter scanning poses less of a risk, scammers have found new, creative ways of deception. One way of doing this is by sending people texts like – ‘Congrats on winning Rs 5,000’ along with the picture of a QR code. The message will urge you to scan the code, enter the amount, followed by your UPI PIN to ‘receive’ the cash in your account. In this scam, gullible people believe that this will credit money in their account, but this does just opposite. You don’t end up ‘receiving’ but actually ‘paying’ the fraudster the amount.
Another tactic is by embedding fake QR codes into a phishing email, text, or via social media. Upon scanning the bogus code, users are directed to websites with realistic-looking landing pages, where the victim may be prompted to login by entering PII (personally identifiable information).
A forged QR code also has the potential to connect to unsecured Wi-Fi network or automatically navigate to a malicious link. Phoney codes may also take you to websites where malware can be automatically downloaded and used to steal sensitive information from your device, or even transfer spyware or viruses.
Public QR codes (like at fuel stations or kiosks) also pose a problem as cybercriminals may swap them by replacing their own QR codes over genuine ones to make money flow into their account. The problem is, there is no way of reading the information contained inside the code before exposing the device to the unsuspecting fraud.
While this type of fraud is relatively unconventional, the technicalities of QR codes are somewhat of a mystery to most users, making them potentially dangerous. Our predictions for 2021 highlight that hackers will increasingly use these QR schemes and broaden them using social engineering techniques.
It’s critical to pay close attention, even to small details while making payments or transactions using QR codes. It is best to pay using these, only in secure and familiar environments. Remember that the risks of scanning an unknown QR are like clicking on links in unknown messages – treat a QR code like any other link – don’t follow it if you don’t fully trust the source.
Once you scan the QR, a pop-up to view its embedded URL must emerge. If there is no URL, or if it seems like a shortened one (like bit.ly) – be cautious. It’s best to install a QR scanner that checks or displays the URL before it follows the link.
Install and update security software regularly across devices. If you suspect any suspicious activity – immediately contact your bank and have them change your login credentials. You may also consider contacting the police and registering a formal complaint with the cyber cell or even an online complaint on the National Cybercrime Reporting Portal – cybercrime.gov.in.
Although the QR codes themselves are a secure and convenient mechanism, we expect them to be misused by cybercriminals in 2021 and beyond. Knowledge of QR code fraud may lag significantly today, but vigilance on our part will ensure the difference between the QR code being scanned and us being scammed.

"When a 30-year-old hotel manager from Chembur, who had been looking to move abroad, saw an email from the “Hilton hotel in Canada” on January 15 offering him a job, he was elated.
He had been looking for a job in a foreign hotel through various portals, including shine.com and linked.in. He was immediately sent an appointment letter and asked to get in touch with “diplomat Mark Brown”.
Brown, in turn, asked him to pay visa fee, programme fee, employment authorisation and basic travelling allowance fee and got him to deposit Rs 17.22 lakh in various bank accounts. After realising that he had been duped since he did not hear back from the hotel, the man filed a complaint with the police.
Eventually, it turned out that four alleged fraudsters fromPune, who were arrested by the cyber police on Monday, hatched the “Canada-based Hilton hotel” email and “diplomat Mark Brown” plan to dupe the complainant.
Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) Milind Bharambe said, “Of the four accused, three hail from Nigeria and one from Sierra Leone. On checking their computers, we found data of 27,000 people… they were probable fraud targets. The details were of people from 48 countries, including France, Philippines and Saudi Arabia, which hints that the accused were involved in conning citizens of other countries as well.”
He added that of the 27,000, the accused had established contacts with around 2,000 people.
DCP (Cyber) Rashmi Karandikar said that they have found 64 accounts in 12 nationalised banks located in various states, includingMaharashtra, Delhi,Uttar PradeshandWest Bengal, which had been used by the accused to deposit the proceeds of crime.
The police suspect these were mule accounts where people are paid a certain percentage by criminals to use their accounts to deposit money from fraudulent activities.
“A total of Rs 2.5 crore were found in these accounts. We also found two accounts of a bank in Nigeria and Dubai. A total of Rs 10 crore had been sent to the Nigerian bank account,” Bharambe said.
“We suspect that a major chunk of this money would have been proceeds of crime and have asked all the bank accounts to be frozen,” he added.
The police have found that while two of the accused had student visas, one had an expired visa. The fourth accused’s passport is yet to be found.

Bharambe said, “So many people fall prey to these scams every day. I would request people to not click on links sent from unknown numbers or email addresses. Also, no employer will directly offer an appointment letter and ask for money to be paid for the same.”

"While the 2020 global pandemic has forced more Indians to go online for activities such as banking, shopping, etc, many are still not sure about staying safe on the internet. Further, nearly 90 percent of those surveyed would take their data privacy more seriously if it was traded like a currency. These were the key findings of a new report by global cyber security firm McAfee.
McAfee’s survey also showed that Indians are more comfortable ordering food online (around 63 percent), compared to say online dating where only 42 percent felt secure. In 2020, online actives like banking (68 percent) financial planning (55 percent), and personal shopping (63 percent) were on top of the list for those surveyed.
But the report also notes that with the increase in online activities, consumers are potentially exposed to more cyber threats. Further, 74 percent of those surveyed were concerned about today’s cyber risks. Nearly 78 percent were worried about financial data being stolen such as credit card information, debit card details, etc.
Around 20 percent respondents admitted that they are not confident in their ability to prevent a cyberattack. Nearly 74 percent of the users were also concerned that their personal information, such as birthday or address, could get hacked.
The survey also showed that 75 percent of respondents adopted or purchased security solutions in 2020. The major reason behind this is to protect personal data from cybercriminals and awareness of increasing cybercrime. The report also said that 51 percent of children under the age of 18 were conducting online activities, while 28 percent children under the age of 12 used digital platforms.
McAfee’s survey is based on an online questionnaire conducted with 1,002 adults over the age of 18 in India, between December 11-23, 2020.

"While there was a 417% jump in the number of cyber fraud complaints filed in Gujarat during the Covid-19 pandemic, only 10 per cent of the Rs 61.64 crore lost by Gujaratis in these frauds were recovered in the past 10 months, states the latest report from the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC).
“In the time of pandemic, the masses at large prefer to use digital mode of banking, as the use of cash is fraught with the spread ofcoronavirus. However, besides the surge in digital transactions, a simultaneous spike was observed in number of cyber fraud cases in recent times, as per data provided by cyber crime cell,Ahmedabad,” stated the SLBC report which was released after a formal meeting of bankers on Monday evening.
Pointing to the trend, it stated, “There is an alarming growth of 417 per cent in cyber fraud complaints.” The number of complaints which stood at 453 in January 2020, shot up to 2,346 by the end of October 2020.
Between January and October 2020, a total of 16,503 complaints involving Rs 61.64 crore were registered in Gujarat. Of this, only Rs 6.03 crore have been recovered so far. During this 10-month period, the highest number of complaints — 2,614 —was lodged in September 2020, involving over Rs 11.07 crore.
“Technology works as boon and also as a bane, goes the saying and the same had been proved aptly relevant in case of adoption of new age technologies in banking, which besides facilitating convenience to large section of customers, has also left a few in the lurch, who easily fall prey to cyber frauds mainly due to lack of their awareness about safeguard to be adhered for using online banking tools.
The modus operandi of cyber frauds in Gujarat revealed that the maximum complaints were related to customer care frauds (2,387) andPayTMKYC (2,073). There were similar complaints related toOLX(1,875) and cashback (1,403). Apart from these, fake identity frauds (1,169), job fraud (1,056) and credit card related frauds (1,013) were the major chunk of complaints.
The report also stated that the Gujarat government had launched project AASHVAT (Assured Assistance Service Helpline for Victims At Shortest Time) through which investigations of all types of cyber crime is being conducted by a team of experts.
MM Bansal, convenor of the SLBC meeting and General Manager of Bank of Baroda, said, “We had invited DCP Cyber Crime, Amit Vasava, to brief us on cyber frauds at the meeting which was held virtually. He had apprised us of the existing situation in the state.”
Deputy Commissioner of Police (Cyber crime cell), Amit Vasava said he cannot confirm or comment on data provided by a different agency. “Very soon we will finish a year for AASHVAT, and we will be releasing detailed analysis of our work,” he added.

"On December 12 last year, Bengaluru city’s cyber crime FIR system registered its 9,999th case. Soon after, it crashed. The automated registry of the main cyber crime police station in India’s IT capital was simply not built to log cases beyond the four-figure mark.
Cut to 2020, and the police would appear to have learned their lesson. Eight specialised cyber crime and economic offences police stations across the city are sharing the burden of the nearly 7,800 cyber-crime cases registered till the end of November.
Bengaluru Police police may have increased its cyber-crime combatting footprint, but a vital issue persists. Only about 10 per cent of cyber-crimes are investigated to the satisfaction of complainants—nearly 60 per cent of whom are people who have lost money in online frauds or have been targeted with morphed pictures.
A key reason for the poor resolution rate, particularly in cases of online monetary fraud, is the crucial time gap between the discovery of the crime by the victim and the registration of a complaint by the police—referred to as the “golden period”.
Now, the Bengaluru Police are now working on creating an automated, real-time system for stopping cyber crimes which will work in conjunction with banks, payment services, internet service providers, social media firms, and even the judiciary, to catch these crimes early.
At the heart of this Cyber Crime Information Report, or CIR, system—likeFirst Information Reportor FIRs—is an information technology-based BPO mechanism being built for the police by a tech firm. The system will alert banks and internet services within around two hours, the golden period, to block a transaction or a social media account reported to be linked to a cyber offence.
“Under the prevailing rules, it is mandatory that you come and file a complaint in the police station and you have to sign theFIR. What we are proposing is that wherever a person is located and gets an intimation of an illegal financial transaction, then he can intimate us in real-time,” said Bengaluru Police Commissioner Kamal Pant.
The Bengaluru Police are looking at setting up a 24/7 BPO system with police officers, technicians and data entry operators who will initiate action to stop a cyber crime as soon as a victim becomes aware of it and alerts the police through the 100 emergency number.
“The moment a person reaches us, a complaint will be created. It will instantaneously alert the nodal officers of concerned banks and service providers. The basic purpose would be to stop further transactions because we have a two hour period to block and reverse transactions with banks. This is the basic objective,” the Bengaluru police commissioner said.
“In cyber crimes, say when you unknowingly share your OTP with someone, it is an action that occurs in hardly 10 seconds. Take a morphed photo. It is sent to a group within seconds. However, to detect these crimes that happen within seconds, the police have to invest more than 1,000 man-hours of work,” he said.
“If we introduce the new system we will be taking care of at least 60 per cent of the cases. In the majority of the cases, the expectation of the victims is that the police should intervene and prevent the personal loss from occurring,” Pant said.
The Bengaluru police are also using the services of a few young, tech-savvy officers who have been posted in the city in recent days to create the real-time system.
“We are fine-tuning the system. We engaged a few companies. Some were not able to provide the perfect solution. We have reached 70 per cent of the creation of the system. Some technical issues have to be resolved by the service provider,” the Police Commissioner said.
Some aspects of software programs being developed by the government of India on similar lines would also be a part of the proposed CIR system.
The Bengaluru Police is working with the judiciary as well to obtain orders in a real-time manner. This is because social media service providers often require court orders to block third-party accounts alleged to be involved in cyber offences.
“We are trying to create a system where even a court order can be obtained to block a social media account that is sharing morphed pictures for instance. We are trying to create a system where a separate contact number is given for these cases. Once we have this then they will block it,” a senior police official said.
Over the past few months, theKarnatakagovernment and the police have been working with banks to bring them on board for rolling out the cyber crime information system.

"On September 15, a senior IPS officer in Karnataka, P Harishekharan, filed a complaint with a CID cyber crime police station in Bengaluru, saying somebody had created a fake Facebook profile with his name and photographs and was seeking funds from his friends.
A day later, CID Deputy Superintendent of Police M H Nagthe lodged a similar complaint.
On October 5, another DSP in the CID, Prakash Rathod, lodged a complaint saying a friend of his friend had donated money after being approached by a fakeFacebookaccount in the DSP’s name.
Investigations in over a dozen similar complaints made by police officers inKarnataka,Tamil NaduandTelanganahaveled the Karnataka CID cyber unitto an organised cybercrime network operating mostly from Bharatpur and other parts ofRajasthan.
The network of operators – including a mobile phone SIM card retailer and a distributor – had created hundreds of fakeAadhaaridentities and issued SIM cards against the fake IDs which were then used to create social media accounts to impersonate the police officers.
The CID have arrested four members of the gang – Balwinder Singh, a SIM card distributor who activated fake accounts; Ansar Khan, a SIM card retailer who sold SIMs against fake Aadhaar IDs; Saini, an accomplice who created the fake Aadhaar ID; and Saddam, a receiver of the funds obtained through the fraud – from Rajasthan and are on the lookout for a fifth suspect, Shakeel Ahmed, who allegedly created fake accounts on Facebook and other social media.
“There is a rise in the number of instances where social media profiles of public figures and officials, including police officers, are being duplicated to cheat the public. The imposter sends friend requests to all the contacts and once accepted, they would induce the persons to transfer money to various e-wallets/payment bank accounts citing some urgent need,” said M D Sharath, Superintendent of Police of the CID cyber crime unit in Karnataka which carried out the recent arrests.
AnFIRregistered on a complaint filed by DSP Prakash Rathod said, “The miscreants downloaded a photograph (of the officer) in police uniform, along with one in plain clothes and created fake profiles and started impersonating. They started contacting Facebook friends and started requesting monetary help by quoting emotional reasons. As a result, one of his Facebook friends transferred Rs 2,000 to the designated account.”
Some IPS officers like Harishekharan, who is the Inspector General of Police for police training in Karnataka, and Deputy Commissioner of Police Bengaluru (East) S D Sharanappa were able to alert friends or get the fake accounts shut down quickly — before the scamsters could have their way.
“My profile is private but they managed to source some of my pictures to create an account. Luckily, the account gathered only 43 followers before I became aware of it. Many of those who got the messages were people in my village and they did not have the new payment systems. We were able to block the account in quick time,” says Sharanappa.
In December 2019, Karnataka IPS officer D Roopa, who is now home secretary, had raised the issue of a fake Instagram account in her name. “This is not my account. I’m not on Instagram. This is brought to my notice only now. Will complain to Cyber crime police station @CIDKarnataka. Meanwhile request those on @instagram to report this issue,” she had tweeted.
Among other officers known to have been recently targeted by the scamsters is Tamil Nadu Additional Director-General of Police (Crime against Women and Children) M Ravi and the Madurai Police Commissioner Davidson Devasirvatham.
The key finding from their investigation, according to cyber crime SP M D Sharath, is the large-scale creation of fake Aadhaar IDs and the issuance of SIM cards without verification.
“The accused persons created fake Aadhaar cards by mixing up various photographs, addresses and Aadhaar numbers. One of the accused persons, a SIM card retailer, used such fake Aadhaar details to apply for activation of thousands of fake SIM cards,” police said. The arrested SIM retailer had allegedly created over a hundred 100 fake Aadhaar IDs using his wife’s photo to get SIM cards issued.
Apart from social media impersonation of police officers and officials, these SIM cards were being used by the gang to carry out scams on re-selling platforms such asOlxandQuikr. “Scamming on reselling platforms is the gang’s main activity; social media impersonation is a small activity,” a police official said.
“Public are advised to not fall prey to such frauds and exercise caution while accepting any request from government officers, especially those who are already in your friends list. Privacy controls provided by social media sites may be used to avoid any misuse of information,” the cyber crime police said.

"“There are crimes of passion and crimes of logic. The boundary between them is not clearly defined,” said Albert Camus, a French-Algerian philosopher, once. The quote finds space in the opening of a booked penned by three officers of the Gujarat Police on tackling challenges associated with cyber crime investigations.
The book, ‘Cyber Crime: Practical Approach towards Cyber Laws and Cyber Crime Investigation’, is co-authored by Additional Commissioner Sharad Singhal (Assistant Commissioner of Police, Crime and Traffic,Surat), IPS officer Sandeep Chaudhary (Deputy Commissioner of Police, Zone 2, Vadodara city) and Gujarat Police Service officer Chirag Desai (deputy superintendent of police, Ankleshwar, Bharuch). It was released by state home minister Pradipsinh Jadeja and Gujarat Director General of Police (DGP) Ashish Bhatia at an event inGandhinagaron Saturday.
The 279-page book is not just a police manual to deal with various types of cyber crime and investigation process but also offers an insight into the futuristic methods being used by criminals in the cyber world, including usage of the dark web.
The book cites case studies from Gujarat where citizens have fallen into the trap of fraudsters from other states as well as cases where fraudsters were physically present to clone bank details of victims to dupe them of lakhs of rupees.
Speaking toThe Indian Express, Sharad Singhal said, “When I was the SP in Jamanagar, we started documenting cases of Cyber Crime Cell to assist the police in dealing with such crimes in future. Then we thought of documenting it into a book to help investigators… It took us three months… A soft copy was made available for all Gujarat Police personnel on the Suraksha Setu app in both English and Gujarati. A hard copy of the book will be given to all police stations and training centres in Gujarat free of cost.”
The book has nine chapters that deal with the sections of the Information Technology (Amendment) Act, Indian Penal Code sections related to cyber crime, standard operating procedure for investigations, common types of cyber crime, emerging technologies and future cyber crimes, open source intelligence, as well as forensic science related to bitcoin currencies.
“We noticed that many times police officers were unable to distinguish between IPC and IT Act sections. This book will help them investigate with forensic method, including obtaining chain of custody, securing digital evidence, obtaining a clone of hard disk, as well as contacting social media platforms such asFacebook, Whatsapp or Instagram. The book also has contact details of all the nodal officers in every state in the country,” said Singhal.
The book also provides an insight into the fast rising statistics of cyber crime and says that recent reports have suggested that India is one of the top five countries to have been affected by cyber crime from 2012 to 2017 and in Gujarat, there was an increase of 400% from 2016 to 2018.
The book has divided cyber crime roughly into three aspects — crime against person (cyber stalking, defamation, hacking, phishing, cloning of cards), crime against property (malware, ransomware, unauthorised trespassing) and crime against government, which includes cyber terrorism and cyber warfare.
The book offers an insight into deep web that is not accessible by conventional search engines such asGoogleandYahoo. It explores the ‘Dark Web’, where users go to conduct illegal activities such as procuring drugs, weapons, child pornography or even getting assassins hired.
“The laws in India are neither regulating the dark web nor its crimes. This serves as the platform for virtual criminals to grow crooked in the dark web by carrying out illegal activities (sic),” said the authors.
The book also discusses futuristic cyber crimes such as “crypto jacking”, remote access attacks, attacks on cell phones and ransomware attacks. Crypto jacking is a crime where computer systems of victims are hacked and used for crypto mining, a process of maintaining a digital ledger by users of all the crypto currency transactions in the deep web. Similarly, ransomware attack refers to injecting a malware inside the computer system to harm the software and extorting money by threat.
“We have dedicated a chapter on Bitcoin crypto currency and other types of crypto currency after we realised that a large number of illegal transactions are being done through Bitcoins. We have also listed a total of 35-40 types of common cyber crimes prevalent in Gujarat, which includes phishing (illegally obtaining bank details of victims through fraud), one-time password scams, Know Your Customer (KYC) upgradation fraud among others,” said Singhal.

"Asking citizens to be cautious while being online, National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval said on Friday financial frauds have seen exponential increase due to greater dependence on digital payment platforms following the COVID-19 pandemic.
He also said the Centre was coming up with the National cyber security strategy-2020 which envisions the safe, secured, trusted, resilient and vibrant cyberspace for India’s prosperity. He was delivering a lecture on Cyber security virtually at the COCONXIII-2020, a data privacy and hacking conference hosted by the Kerala Police and the Society for the Policing of Cyberspace and Information Security Research Association.
According to him, there is a change in the work environment that has been brought upon by the pandemic. “There is a greater dependence on digital payment platform due to reduced cash handling and greater data sharing is happening online and presence on social media has also increased.
“While we are able to manage our affairs online to a certain extent, malicious actors also found in it, a new opportunity,” Doval said.
Doval said there was an increase of 500 per cent in cyber crimes due to limited awareness and cyber hygiene. “Financial frauds have seen exponential increase due to greater dependence on digital payment platforms. The adversaries are tempted to exploit the crisis situation through various misinformation, fake news etc. The huge cyber data floating in the cyber space is a gold mine for extracting information that can undermine the privacy of our citizens..,” Doval said.
He cautioned citizens while being online and said a responsible approach should be there while using internet. The NSA complimented the state government and the Kerala police for the initiative.
Inaugurating the conference, KeralaGovernor ArifMohammed Khan said with the increased reliance on the internet becoming a permanent feature of people’s lives due to COVID- 19, citizens need to be extra cautious while being online.
This edition of the conference was on the virtual platform this year due to the pandemic scenario. “Various types of cyber crimes are happening in our country and it’s high time that we take proper precautions against such crimes…,” Khan said.
Senior police officials, including state police chief Loknath Behera, participated on the first day of the two-day conference.

"The Police State Cyber Crime Cell Thursday busted a high-tech multi-crore bank fraud racket operating in the state and arrested the key member of the three-person gang, Amit Sharma alias Nitin. The team nabbed Sharma from Shimlapuri area of Ludhiana.
Disclosing this, ADGP-cum-Director, Bureau of Investigation, Arpit Shukla, said the cybercrime cell had investigated this case on the complaint of Vijay Kumar, Location Manager of HDFC Bank, who had alleged that a fraud of around Rs 2 crore from a HDFC bank account was committed in a tech savvy manner.
During the investigation, it was found that the fraudster had siphoned off money from the account and transferred it to five different bank accounts. These bank accounts were opened on a fake identity. The money was later withdrawn from these accounts by way cash from ATMs and self cheques.
Revealing the modus operandi, the ADGP said the fraudsters changed email IDs and mobile numbers registered with the bank account of the victim to identical mobile numbers and email IDs, thereby updating their own mobile numbers and Email IDs in the targeted accounts hence becoming virtual controllers.
In this case Amit Sharma alias Nitin impersonated himself as Akash Arun Bhatia (victim of the case) and gained internet access of his bank account. Thereafter the accused transferred the money to five different accounts opened in the name of Vikram Singh by submitting forged documents.
The ADGP further informed that during the course of investigation it was found that all government identity proofs including chip-based driving licenses, PAN cards, hologram containing Voter ID cards, etc provided as KYC documents for opening of bank accounts and for obtaining mobile numbers were found to be fake and fabricated. All the money withdrawals were done by the fraudsters through ATM cards and cheques, thereby leaving no trail for the police to follow.
Moreover, the mobile numbers were made functional only during the commission of the crime and remained non-accessible thereafter, the ADGP added.
Elaborating further, Shukla said they found that the racketeers were operating fromLudhianaas the mobile phones were located there when being used for the crime. Physical searches and door-to-door verification of the area where these phones were operational were conducted during investigation.
Shukla said that that three accused were nominated in this case as accused during investigation and out of them two accused namely Rajiv Kumar and Deepak Kumar Gupta of Shimlapuri were arrested on January 28 from Shimlapuri, Ludhiana.
However, one accused managed to escape on that day. A special team was formed to nab Amit Sharma, a resident of Deol Enclave, Ludhiana and the third member of the gang.
“This accused was absconding since January 8 and it has been found that he is wanted in six FIRs registered in various police stations in Punjab and Haryana in multi-crore frauds,” the ADGP revealed.
AnFIRin this regard was registered at the State Cyber Cell in Phase IV under relevant sections of the Information Technology Act and the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

A large number of these hate speech cases stem from the Covid-19 cases linked to theTablighi Jamaatmeet in Delhi, which turned out to be a hotpsot for the infection, and the subsequent accusations and counter-accusations. “The hate messages in registered cases have come from people from both communities,” said a senior officer.
“In the beginning, we had observed a surge in hate speech cases and those are being reported even today. These hate speech cases are communal in nature. We have adopted a no-tolerance policy towards hate speech, fake news and misinformation. These type of messages on the online platforms are potential precursors to serious law and order issues. Maharashtra Cyber is keeping a close watch on cases of hate speech, fake news and reporting them to cyber crime units in individual jurisdictions for further action. Take-down notices are being issued to all concerned platforms of social media and removal process is continuously on”, said Superintendent of Police with Maharashtra Cyber, Dr. Balsing Rajput.
He added, “While hate speech cases continue to get reported, there are also cases pertaining to misinformation about lockdown-related issues and employment opportunities. We have come across malicious messages being circulated with intention to cheat people. A prohibitory notice applicable across Maharashtra has been issued against circulating offensive, abusive, defamatory or malicious posts about Covid-19 and connected issues. Posting any such messages on Internet-based platforms is prosecutable under the Information Technology Act.”
The numbers shared by Maharashtra Cyber show that of the 400 cases, certain police jurisdictions have registered very high number of cases, including Beed (40),PuneRural (31), Jalgaon (29),Mumbai(21), Kolhapur (16), Nashik Rural (16).
Officials maintained that higher number of cases in particular jurisdictions are a result of more people coming forward to report them, as well as the role played by local cyber units in getting these cases registered. Of the 400 cases, 169 are about messages on WhatsApp, 157 aboutFacebookposts, 18 on Tik-Tok, seven on Twitter and four on Instagram.
According to Maharashtra Cyber officials, there have been increasing cases of people being cheated through online transactions on the pretext of home delivery of food, alcohol or other items. “We have observed that cyber fraudsters create new web pages resembling names of shops, home delivery services, etc to lure people into making online transactions on the pretext of purchases. We are making an appeal to people to cross- check all the details of the platform before making any payments. This is yet another way in which cyber criminals are exploiting the vulnerabilities of people during the Covid-19 crisis,” said an official.

"Amidst the nationwide lockdown due to the COVID-19, RBI had grantedthree-month loan moratoriumto borrowers, meaning they will not have to pay EMIs and other loans during this period. However, cybercriminals are using this information as bait to trick people.
Banks like SBI, Axis, ICICI and others are warning their customers to protect themselves against the EMI moratorium frauds. The scammers try to gain access to borrowers’ banking details as they request OTP or other forms of passwords claiming to help them postpone EMI payments.
“People receive calls from call centres asking them to share their bank account details to avail moratorium on their home loan EMI. The point to remember here is that no bank will ever call you upfront asking for your bank details like OTP, CVV, password or PIN, for providing a moratorium on the EMI,” Rajesh Kumar, Director Cybersecurity, Netrika Consulting told theindianexpress.com.
EMI moratorium option has been around for a long time but it has come to the forefront after RBI Circular amid the lockdown. Fraudsters are using the chance to trick borrowers who have confusion regarding the whole thing.

“Gullible people end up sharing their sensitive financial details and are made to click on links that immediately cost them money. Elderly and lesser-educated people are profiled by fraudsters as people who aren’t tech-savvy and take the decision in haste,” Kumar said.
Warning against such fraudulent practices, Kumar said bank customers should be aware and stay vigilant to stay safe. “One should be confident of whom they are talking to before sharing details or initiating any financial transaction,” he said.
He also advised being careful about the mode of the transaction while making a payment or providing consent with the password, OTPs, or other sensitive information.
“If using a URL for payment, re-verify it as there are malicious websites that appear very similar to the original one with an almost identical interface as the original one,” Kumar said.
People who have already shared their OTP/CVV/password/PIN with the fraudster, should immediately inform the bank through genuine published numbers or links, and request them to stop any related transaction if it is in progress. Kumar recommends to lodge a formal complaint with the cyber cell of Police and in case they are unavailable or unreachable, report to the nearest police station.
Ever since the pandemic started, fraudsters have managed to devicecountless methods based on the coronavirusand related news to scam unsuspecting users. A report published by Barracuda Networks claimed there has already been a steady increase in the number ofCOVID-19-related email attacks since January.
Between March 1 and March 23, Barracuda Sentinel, a monitoring platform infused with artificial intelligence, detected 467,825 spear-phishing email attacks out of which 9,116 detections were related to COVID-19.
Cybercriminals are even using thecoronavirusscare for ransom. The old‘dirty little secret’ sextortion campaignshave been tweaked to claim that they’ll infect the receiver’s family with coronavirus if they do not pay. Another report by Sophos Labs found thatIndia is among the top 10 sextortion email sourcecountries.

"Cybercriminals are riding the coronavirus pandemic waveto trick hundreds and thousands of peoplearound the world. They have been setting upfake COVID-19 tracker dashboardsto hack computers, putting upmalicious websites and appsrelated to coronavirus,posing as WHO officialsto carrying out phishing attacks, promisingfree mobile data, sending out ransom emailsthreatening to infect users with COVID-19, and more.
In light of the risingCOVID-19 online scams,GoogleSafety Centre has shared some tips to help you spot and avoid these frauds and stay safe online. Google also lists down types of theseCOVID-19 scamsthat include fake requests for charitable donations, fraudulent medical offers, impersonation of authorities like ICMR and MoHFW, andfake offers of goods and services.
Google saysthat scammers are disguising their scams as legitimate messages about the virus. They may use emails, SMS, automated calls or malicious websites to reach you. It lists down some tips to help you avoid such scams:
Check trusted sources directly:Scammers often use identity theft to pose as trusted and authoritative sources. Users should directly visit sources like the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) to get the latest factual information about COVID‑19 and do not fall prey to these frauds.
Be cautious about sharing information:If you receive an unsolicited request for some kind of information, be cautious and take extra time to evaluate the message. Scammers ask you to share information like login information, bank details, and addresses, which is not required for a genuine helpline call.
Donate carefully:Fraudsters take advantage of goodwill and request donations forCOVID-19relief efforts. They also impersonate non-profit organisations to trick you into transferring money. To make a donation, you can directly visit the NGO’s website instead of clicking links sent to you.
Also read |Jio, Facebook giving free 25GB daily data for 6-months? Beware, it’s a new COVID-19 scam
Do not click random links:Google advises not to click on random links sent in an unsolicited email. Before clicking a hyperlink, users should hover over the link to see where it leads.
Search on the web:If you receive a fraudulent message or email, it’s likely the scammers have sent the same message to other people as well. Copy and paste the text or the most suspicious part into a search engine to check if it’s been reported by others. Chances are, you will find media reports regarding such kind of scams.

Apart from the tips shared by Google, we would like to suggest that if you receive a fraudulent message and you are sure about it being a cybercrime attempt, make sure you tell others about it so that they can be aware as well. Also, if you see something suspicious you can report it to g.co/reportphishing or g.co/reportmalware.

China & supply of electronic components for ‘made in India’Subscriber Only“GOOD NEWS! Jio and Facebook are giving 25GB Data Daily for 6 months to all Jio users due to lockdown of COVID-19.” If you have received a text message with this claim, it means you one of the many targets of anew cybercrime.
Reliance Jiohas not announced any such offer and fraudsters are simply using thedeal between Facebook and Relianceas a bait to make their claim sound authentic. To make the claim believable, they threw in theCOVID-19 lockdown in the mixas well.
“We periodically caution customers through SMS and other mass means of communication in order to address the menace of false claims by misleading websites,” a Jio spokesperson told theIndianexpress.com. “The reference information is false and misleading. We request our customers, through you, not to fall for such false propaganda.”
This particular text message is being sent by an India-based mobile number. The message also asks users to download an app to avail the offer with a link that takes the user to a website made with Weebly — a free website builder.
At the website, the user is asked to download an app with the claim, “Jio & FB has announced today to give free 25GB data daily with free calls for 6-MONTHS to all Jio Users. Activate this Jio Offer without any cost using all-new Prime app [sic].”
The website obviously doesn’t belong to Jio and uses a template provided by Weebly. Apart from the homepage, every other page of the website carries the template text and pictures. The fraudster probably made the site in a hurry and did not have the time to finish it.

So I would recommend to not download the said application.

"The Cyber Crime Cell of Gujarat Police are now looking into cases of online fraud after multiple cases emerged in the state where victims have been approached by fraudsters masquerading as bank or digital wallet representatives urging them to upgrade Know Your Customer (KYC) details.
According to police, inAhmedabad, Deepak Dave (56) from Thaltej lost Rs 37,000 on Sunday after he was asked to download ‘Support Team Wear’ mobile application by a person claiming to be aPaytmrepresentative.
“The victim received a call on Sunday where the accused told him that he was calling from Paytm to inform him that his KYC had not been updated and his Paytm wallet would be terminated. When the victim asked for assistance, the accused asked him to download an app fromGoogleplay store ‘Support Team Wear’ wherein he was asked to submit bank details. After some time, the victim received messages on his phone that he has lost Rs 37,000 through different transactions,” said A M Jadeja, police inspector, Vastrapur police station.
In another case in Sabarkantha, a 48-year-old man lost Rs 1.39 lakh on April 24, after an unknown person, claiming to be representative of Paytm, called the victim and asked him to download an application called ‘Quick Support’ from play store.
The victim has been identified as Falgun Thakkar, a resident of Himatnagar of Sabarkantha, on whose credit card, several transactions amounting to Rs 1,39,640 was made on April 24. However, as the victim realised the fraud, he contacted the Sabarkantha Cyber Crime Cell, which then informed the nodal officer of Paytm to register all transactions made recently on the credit card as fraud.
“The victim had received a call from an unknown person who claimed to be a Paytm representative and told him that his KYC hadn’t been updated. The victim was then asked to download an app called ‘Quick Support’ and submit details. He then started receiving messages regarding transactions made on his credit card worth Rs 1.39 lakh. Luckily, he informed us immediately and we managed to stop the transactions from the credit card in time,” said an officer at Sabarkantha Cyber Crime Cell.
After multiple cases of such banking fraud emerged in the state, the Gujarat Cyber Crime Cell issued an advisory to all district police regarding apprising their citizens of such frauds.
“Be aware of any message that you receive on your phone regarding updating KYC of Paytm or any other digital wallet. Any KYC upgradation can be done only at authorised KYC points or by representatives of the digital wallet who will reach at your doorstep. Never share any personal or banking related information on phone,” said the advisory.

"Researchers from the British cybersecurity firm Sophos traced the origin of millions ofsextortion spam emailssent between September 2019 and February 2020 to conclude that India is among the top 10 sextortion mail source countries.
Being the source of 3.73 per cent of all sextortion emails, India is placed at fifth position preceded by Vietnam at the top (7.01 per cent), Brazil at second (5.89 per cent), Argentina at third (4.76 per cent), and Korea at fourth (4.76 per cent).
The SophosLabs report highlighted that the scams exploited global botnets on compromised PCs to dispatch these mails around the world. As per the report, Vietnam, Brazil, Argentina, the Republic of Korea, India, Italy, Mexico, Poland, Colombia, and Peru are the top 10 countries where these compromised computers were used to dispatch the spam messages.
Sextortion is a widely used form of spam attack where cybercriminals extort money by claiming to have receiver’s compromising pictures or evidence of their sexual activity. The attacker threatens to share such pieces of evidence with the receiver’s friends and family unless they pay ransom money.

Providing more insight Counterpoint Technology Research Analyst Satyajit Sinha told theIndianexpress.comthat “Sextortion email is not different from any other phishing. It’s more of a subcategory of ransomware emails. It includes malware that can hack the system upon accepting or activating the link.”
“The trend is to use cryptocurrencies as the mode of digital currency it’s almost untraceable. Hence, these funds can be used for all other cyber-criminal activities on the dark web,” he added.
SophosLabs researchers worked with CipherTrace to track the flow of the money from the attackers’ bitcoin wallets. They found that the extorted funds were used in other illicit activities such as buying stolen credit card data and transacting with dark web marketplaces. Other funds were moved through a series of wallet addresses to be consolidated, put through ‘mixers’ in an attempt to launder the transactions, or converted to cash, the report said.

They have been putting upmalicious websites and appsrelated toCOVID-19, setting upfake COVID-19 tracking dashboardsto hack computers, carrying out phishing attacksposing as WHO officials, running coronavirus-themed spam campaigns and more.

"For cyber crime such as vishing, which take place from within the confines of four walls, the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has not had any impact on fraudsters.
Unlike other crimes that have seen a dip,MumbaiPolice said they have received information that there have been rampant cases of fraudulent phone calls from across the country, prompting an advisory. While the traditional modus operandi of fraudsters, who claim that they are calling from the bank, is the same, they are now making excuses linked toCOVID-19to cheat people.
An officer said with Reserve Bank of India (RBI) allowing banks to grant a three-month moratorium on loan repayments, cyber fraudsters have been calling people posing as bank employees and cheating them.
In some cases, police have found that fraudsters have been sending SMSes to people, claiming to be from their bank and asking them to download particular applications that helps them gain control over mobile phones.
The police Monday had to release a note to caution people. They have mentioned two kinds of modus operandi in their note. In the first case, a person calls up a victim pretending to be from the bank. “The caller tells the victim that if he wants to avail three-month moratorium on EMI, he would need to provide some details so that it could be updated on their systems,” an officer said.
The fraudsters then take these details, including One Time Password (OTP), and withdraw money from bank account. The officer said another way was sending SMSes to people claiming to be from the bank. The SMS asks people to download apps such as Any Desk, Quick Support, Team Viewer, using which they gain control of the victim’s mobile phone. The fraudsters then make fraudulent transactions using the details.
A senior officer said, “Callers normally operate from small rooms, where they are provided bank details of victims and phone numbers. They keep changing their modus operandi from time to time and, this time around, they are using announcements made regarding COVID-19.”
Deputy Commissioner of Police (Cyber) Vishal Thakur said, “We have been informed that fraudsters have been using excuses to cheat people across the country. Hence, we have issued an advisory.”

"A total of 751 FIRs have been registered in last two years in Ahmedabad, Surat, Rajkot and Vadodara and 365 chargesheets have been filed against 1,167 arrests in cyber crime cases, the state government told the Assembly on Monday.
The information was shared by Home Minister Pradeepsinh Jadeja in response to a written query raised by Congress MLA from Dariyapur constituency Gyasuddin Shaikh on the number of cyber crime cases reported in last two years from the four cities.
Keeping in view the number of cases of child pornography that have come to light in the recent past along with instigating communal violence through social media, Shaikh raised these issues during the question hour.
While he requested the state government to ban such films and videos, Jadeja said the state government was serious about the issue and would ensure strict action to stop the menace.
“The state government is aggressive in curbing attempts to create a divide between different communities on basis of social media reports and the government has also worked in creating awareness among masses,” he added.
The written reply by the minister revealed that as investigations into 81 cases are under progress, a total of 751 cyber crime FIRs have been registered in cities ofAhmedabad,Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot in 2018 and 2019. Against these FIRs, during the same period, a total of 1,167 accused has been nabbed and of them, 365 have been charged under IT Act’s section 66 (C), 66 (D), 67 and 67 (A) and IPC 406, 409, 419 and 420.

The state government has also developed cyber cells in nine range where there is provision of registering complaints at the cyber cell of CID (Crime),” he told the House.
However, during the discussion, the Leader of Opposition Paresh Dhanani raised the issue of breaching of privacy accusing spying through tapping of phone calls. To this, the minister assured that the state government has no intention or planning to interfere in personal lives.

"While the number of cyber crimes in the city is on the rise, incidents of people being defrauded over promises of winning an online lottery, or availing services of a dating website, have become a cause for concern.
In a case registered with the Vishrambag police station on December 15, a 59-year-old retired person, who was offered a ‘lottery prize’ of Rs 12.8 lakh, ended up paying a much higher amount, Rs 17.5 lakh, to cyber criminals.
As per numbers obtained fromPuneCity Police, the Cyber Crime Cell has received 37 complaints of online lottery frauds and 32 on online dating frauds so far this year. This does not include the number of similar complaints filed at different police stations of Pune City Police and Pimpri-Chinchwad Police.
Why people fall for such scams
A common link between all the victims seems to be that they are well-educated. “In almost all the online lottery and dating cyber frauds, we found that the victims were well-educated. They blindly believe in the cyber fraudsters, who get in touch with them over mobile phones and through social media, and get cheated,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police (cyber crime) Sambhaji Kadam.
On the latest such case, Police inspector R S Rajmane of Vishrambag police station said, “Fraudsters allegedly contacted a well-educated retired person over phone in August 2017 and told him that he has won a lottery of Rs 12.8 lakh from an online shopping website. He believed in the fraudsters so much that following their instructions, he transferred over Rs 17. 5 lakh into multiple bank accounts in different installments, as charges to claim the lottery amount. It is strange as the victim paid a few lakhs more than the lottery amount assured to him by the cyber criminals.”
In another case with the Chikhali police station, a complainant who lost Rs 65 lakh to cyber fraudsters works as manager in a major automobile company. After coming in contact with cyber fraudsters through a ‘dating website’ in May 2019, he transferred a total of Rs 65 lakh into different bank accounts as per their instructions. He was told that the money was ‘holding charge’ for account verification, commission, and other purposes. When he didn’t get the services assured by the ‘dating site’, he approached police.
The complainant even took a loan to make some of these payments to the cyber criminals behind the ‘dating service’.
In a case lodged in February this year, a 38-year-old IT professional in Pune was duped by online fraudsters after he befriended a woman on a dating website, who made him pay Rs 23 lakh under various pretexts. She told the complainant that she had come to Delhi from abroad and pretended to face various problems at the airport on arrival.
Modus operandi of cyber fraudsters
According to cyber security expert Rohit Srivastava, online fraudsters manage to collect a large amount of information about their potential victims. “A huge amount of data, like phone numbers and email addresses, is collected in different ways… for example, asking someone to fill a form for some lottery prize in a mall or at a petrol pump… This bulk data is sold to cyber fraudsters, who then contact these people by making phone calls, sending SMSs and emails etc about fraudulent schemes like online lotteries.
Some of those who are contacted get lured by the promise of making some fast cash… and get cheated…,” he said.
Fraudsters often ask their targets to transfer money into different bank accounts as various ‘charges’ for receiving the lottery prize, availing dating services and other fake reasons, said police.
DCP Kadam said cyber criminals lure people from poor backgrounds to open such accounts in different banks, and then keep their ATM cards. After money is transferred by the victims to the ‘beneficiary’ bank accounts, fraudsters withdraw it immediately. Some part of the money is given to ‘beneficiary’ account holders.
“It is essential that banks conduct stringent verification of KYC documents while opening bank accounts,” said Kadam.
Police said cyber fraudsters based in one city often target people from other cities. Some of the cyber fraudsters also have international links. Last year, police had arrested a Nigerian national from Delhi for allegedly cheating a Pune man of Rs 16.5 lakh through a fake online lottery scheme.
Police said the victim had received an email about winning an online lottery of Rs 1.7 crore. The victim replied to the email and fraudsters asked him to deposit Rs 45,800 as ‘tax code’, Rs 2.48 lakh as ‘account upgradation charges’ and Rs 1.7 lakh as ‘anti-terrorist charges’ in different bank accounts. They also sent a fake card of a Scotland-based bank to the victim and made him pay Rs 6 lakh for activating it, and another Rs 4.45 lakh as other charges. But after making all these payments online, the victim never got any ‘lottery prize’.
Preventive steps that can be taken
“So far, we have arrested 43 people in connection with different cyber crime cases this year, but people should be cautious while sharing their personal information,” said DCP Kadam.
Police said citizens should avoid submitting details like bank account numbers, ATM card numbers and other information with strangers or any unknown person over the phone.
Suspicious online offers and messages, or emails sent by unknown persons, should be ignored. Also, citizens should report to the police any suspicious contact numbers and emails that offer fraudulent schemes. No money transfers should be made to any bank account without confirmation about the scheme offered online by any website.

"A Chennai-based techie was arrested for allegedly tricking women into sending nude pictures and videos in return for a front-office job in popular IT firms and hotels.
The 35-year-old accused, identified as Clement Raj Chezhiyan, was taken into custody from his Chennai home on Friday and brought toHyderabadafter a local woman lodged a complaint. The accused, who is an employee of an IT company, had allegedly collected details of more than 600 women from job profile sites.
Explaining his modus operandi, the police said Clement Raj used to introduce himself to the women aspirants as Pradeep, an HR executive of a private IT firm or a hotel, through Whatsapp. He would inform the women that they have cleared their first-round and a female Human resource executive would be contacting them for the next set of interviews. In the next few hours, Raj would switch to a different number and contact the women masquerading as a woman HR.
After a couple of interactions, the aspirants would be asked to send their nude pictures and videos to the woman HR, specifying that the organisation was very particular about the candidate’s figure as it is a front-office job, the police said. The women who were in desperate need of a job fell prey to the perpetrator. According to reports, the lured women hail from different states likeAndhra Pradesh, Telengana,Karnataka,Maharashtra,Tamil Nadu, Delhi, etc.
Speaking toindianexpress.com, Venkatesh Shamala, the Inspector of Police Hyderabad, (Miyapur Division) said, “Clement Raj targeted the women who put their resume on websites seeking a front-office executive job. He will message the aspirants through Whatsapp and after gaining their confidence he will be contacting them through his another number disguising as a woman HR. He would make sure the women get deceived with his talks. After a few days, he would be asking the women to send nude pictures stating the office requires a pleasing personality at the front desk.”
In April, a woman from Cyberabad in Hyderabad lodged a complaint at the Miyapur Police Station stating she had been cheated by Clement Raj.
“The woman who complained to us was cheated similarly. She was asked to send her pictures to another number that Clement was having. She was promised that if she sends her pictures the company would select her as a model and will make her posters get placed in front of a popular hotel. A few days later, she was contacted by him in the name of Pradeep and was informed that her pictures were beautiful. The lady immediately got suspicious since she believed that she sent her pictures to the lady HR executive. She had asked him how he got the pictures and started to ask about the company’s address and other details. The man immediately hung up the phone and never replied to her back,” the Inspector said.
The police then started to investigate and found out that a person working in an MNC company in Chennai had been carrying out these activities for more than a year.
Clement Raj is currently lodged in Cheralapathy jail, near Hyderabad. He was produced before the court. His mobile phones and other electronic gadgets were seized. Raj is married and the couple has a seven-year-old daughter.

"Bengaluru Police filed an FIR against a Facebook page administrator after city mayor Gangambike Mallikarjun alleged that it was being used to spread fake news against her. According to the complaint handed over to City Police Commissioner Alok Kumar on July 20, the mayor alleged that ‘Modi Bhakta’, a Kannada Facebook page, was running a “misinformation campaign” that she is against the setting up of Ganesh pandals on roads.
“The post on theFacebookpage is part of a misinformation campaign run against me saying that I am against allowing people of the Hindu community in the city to celebrate Ganesh festival by setting up pandals on the road. Several people have shared the post as well, with some of them, including a user named Manikanta Bharadwaj, using abusive language while sharing the post,” she said in the letter.

The complaint also includes a couple of Facebook links of the posts. Mayor Gangambike added that the post “hurt her religious feelings” and has also led to “trolling and (her) husband facing baseless allegations”.
Bharadwaj toldIndianexpress.comthat she has been an active participant in the Ganesh festival. “It hurts me more as, in fact, I had even extended the festival organised at the National College grounds from three to eleven days. I have never put forth any plan to stop these celebrations, as wrongly alleged in the post,” she said.

"To deal with the rising number of cybercrime cases, the Mumbai Police has proposed that the rule calling for a police inspector (PI) level investigation of such offences to be relaxed, allowing police sub-inspector (PSI) rank officers to carry out probes as well.
TheMumbaiPolice made the proposal at a cybercrime meeting called by the Intelligence Bureau in New Delhi last month. The same proposal was also put forward by several other police forces.
While 928 cyber crime cases were registered in 2016, 736 cases were registered between January and May this year. Most police stations in the city have around four to five PI-level officers.
“The quality of investigation suffers if one officer is investigating 50 cases,” said a senior officer.
The officer pointed out that in the past, only ACP-level officers were allowed to probe cyber crimes. However, with the rising number of cases, the IT act had earlier been amended and PI-level officers were included.
Others pointed out that apart from having more officers to investigate, normally, younger policemen joining at the PSI level and even in the constabulary are more adept at solving cybercrime cases. “Some of these PI-level officers are a few years away from retirement. There can be a lack of enthusiasm to learn new kinds of offences. Conversely, the younger crop is already on social media,” said the officer..
Sources said that in most cases, lower rung personnel carry out a major chunk of the investigation. “However, the PI is the one who has to appear in court for remand or during the trial… If they are not well versed with the technology, the defence could use it to their advantage. It would make more sense to have someone who knows how the investigation took place to defend the case,” said an officer

"A constable posted with Oshiwara police station recently fell prey to cyber fraudsters when he lost Rs 1 lakh from his salary account. The Oshiwara police, which is probing the matter, said that constable Gokul Devare lost the money in 10 transactions.
Police said on November 3, Devare, a resident of Jogeshwari (West), received a text message on his cellphone stating that Rs 100 has been withdrawn from his bank account. “Before I could react, a second message arrived staring that Rs 24,900 has been debited from my account,” Devare said in his complaint.
Following this, he went to the nearest branch of his bank and realised that his debit card has been blocked by the cyber fraudsters. “Between 1.30 pm and 2 pm on November 3, I received another eight messages that said Rs 75,000 have been transferred from my account,” Devare said.
The constable then lodged a complaint with the bank and he approached the Oshiwara police station. A case has been registered under IPC and IT Act.
Devare said he could not celebrate Diwali this year as he was just left with Rs 14,000 in his account. “My relative from my native place had come over to celebrate Diwali with my family. But a day after my salary was deposited in my account, I lost Rs 1 lakh,” said the constable.

"The woman, who hails from Pune, was residing at a relative’s place in Ghatkopar when she was alerted about the fake Facebook profiles. After she found eight fake profiles that had her photos and names with obscene comments, she approached the Ghatkopar police where an FIR was registered in August.
Senior inspector Sudhir Nigudkar then formed a team under inspector Vilas Datir, sub inspector Mohan Jagdale and constable Santosh Gidh to investigate the matter. During the course of investigation, it came to light that the profiles had been created from a mobile phone that was registered in the name of the complainant. “We then wrote toFacebookasking them to block the eight pages and also sought information on who created the pages,” an officer said.
Earlier this month, the police received information from Facebook that hinted at Thigale having created the Facebook accounts. “During investigation, it came to light that Thigale’s sister who was a friend of the victim had been using the SIM card registered in the victim’s name. She had given her to use it. Knowing that he could be traced using his own number, he would insert the victim’s SIM card and create these accounts,” an officer said.
A police team then went to the Rajguru Nagar area ofPune, where he lived. “The accused had fled. But we managed to track him down. He has been arrested on charges of defamation and sections of the Information Technology Act,” an officer said.

"The state government lists the establishment of the Prevention of Atrocities against Women (PAW) cell as a key step towards ensuring the safety of women. But even six months after the cell was converted into an independent department, the government is still to appoint a head for the unit with the post currently handled as an additional charge by Special Inspector General (VIP Security) Krishna Prakash.
Established in 1995, the unit suffers from a lack of basic infrastructure, including staff, office space and computers; it also lacks any special training. According to sources, in the past year, the PAW cell of theMaharashtraPolice has investigated just one case, in which the Supreme Court expressed dissatisfaction with the probe.
A staff member attached to the cell said in 2016, the responsibility of the cell was handed to Special Inspector General (Cyber Crime) Brijesh Singh. Later, in July 2017, it was passed on to Inspector General (Protection of Civil Rights) Quaiser Khalid. However, in December 2017, while hearing a writ petition regarding a 26-year-old woman missing since 2014, the Bombay High Court ordered that “dedicated teams and cells will have to be set up and the persons in-charge of such cells put under rigorous training. They should be guided by seniors who have successfully investigated such cases in the past and maybe retired police officers can also be brought in together with social workers and persons from the legal field and all of them may also seek the assistance of experts in medical science”.
Following the order, the state government issued a Government Resolution on March 8 this year and created an ‘independent post’ of Special IG (Prevention of Atrocities against Women). But after six months, no one has been appointed to the post.
Currently, the PAW unit has 11 posts, including two Deputy Superintendents of Police. “Only one DySP was appointed and she too is away on UN deputation. Apart from that, two police inspectors have been attached to the department along with two constables and an equal number of clerks in addition to staff,” a staff member said. “We do not have a proper office and work from around the VIP security cell. Since we still do not have computers, we use our personal mobile phones to get official documents or forward them. Due to the absolute lack of infrastructure, even senior officers among us are looking to get out of the department.”
In the only case investigated by the PAW unit in the past year, it faced flak from the Supreme Court this March. The cell had investigated a case in which 68 girls fromRajasthanwere rescued from Shahada town in Nandurbar district. After finding out that the PAW unit had only chargesheeted two brothel keepers and not investigated how the girls were pushed into flesh trade, a division bench of Justice J Chelameswar and Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul remarked, “If that is the degree of efficiency of investigation, it is not safe to leave the investigation to the hands of the officers present in court. Having regard to the dimensions of the case and the implications of the social problem, apart from question of law, we deem it appropriate to direct the Director General of Police, Maharashtra, to be present before this court.”
A staff member said if serious investigations are to be conducted across the state, the attitude of the government towards the PAW cell will have to change. “This is the cell that files affidavits before the court in sensitive cases. They should realise the sensitive nature of the cases we investigate and impart proper training to staff members to deal with complex crimes like inter-state human trafficking in addition to providing infrastructure,” said the staff member.
When contacted, Special IG Krishna Prakash said, “While currently there are some teething troubles, we should soon move to our new office at the World Trade Centre. We are hopeful the staff strength and other infrastructure problems will be taken care of.”

"Two more suspects have been arrested in connection with the malware attack on Cosmos Bank, taking the total number of arrested suspects to four. Police are now investigating how the four arrested suspects — one from Bhiwandi, two from Aurangabad and one from Nanded — were tapped by cyber criminals and why they assembled at Kolhapur, where they allegedly withdrew large sums of money at the time of the attack.
On Thursday, the Special Investigation Team (SIT) ofPuneCity Police arrested two more persons — Shaikh Mohammed Jabbar from Sillod town in Aurangabad district and Mahesh Rathod from Bhokar town in Nanded district. The latest arrests were made based on the information gathered from the interrogation of the two suspects arrested on Tuesday, Fahim Shaikh from Bhiwandi in Thane and Fahim Khan from Sillod.
The remand application filed by the investigating officer of the case, Jairam Paigude, stated, “The arrested suspects come from various places and there was a well-planned conspiracy involving them. A probe needs to be conducted into how these people received information stolen from the hacked server and how and why they came together at Kolhapur. All four arrested suspects will be interrogated together.”
A police official connected to the probe said, “All the arrested persons come from modest economic backgrounds and do not seem to have advanced technical know-how. We are probing how and why these people were tapped by the cybercriminals and if there is a common link between them.”
In a massive cyber attack, several cloned debit cards of the Pune-based cooperative bank were used for thousands of ATM transactions from India and 28 other countries in a period of seven hours on August 11.
While around Rs 78 crore was withdrawn in more than 12,000 ATM transactions outside India, another 2,800 transactions were made in different places within India, to the tune of Rs 2.5 crore. Further, on August 13, Rs 13.5 crore was transferred to a Hong Kong-based entity using the Society for Worldwide Interbank Telecommunications (SWIFT) facility. Investigation revealed that while the transactions outside India were done through VISA cards, those in India were done through Rupay cards. A total of Rs 94 crore was siphoned off.
The SIT had zeroed in on the suspects based on footage from security cameras installed in several ATM kiosks in Kolhapur, where a group of at least seven persons had withdrawn nearly Rs 89 lakh using over 90 cloned cards. Four of the culprits have been arrested. In a similar manner, money was withdrawn from ATMs in Indore,Mumbai, Kolhapur, Ajmer and other places, using cloned cards at the time ofthe attack.
Investigators have sought more information from Interpol about the transactions that took place in 237 banks in 28 foreign countries. In the third week of August, police had started recovering the money from some customers of the bank, who had found excess account balance during the time of the attack and withdrawn money using their own cards.
Police had said these account holders were accidental beneficiaries of the cyber attack and did not prima facie have any criminal connection with the alleged hackers. Till now, police have recovered over Rs 3.5 lakh from 27 such beneficiaries.

"Vodafone was on Thursday directed to pay Rs 4.5 lakh to a Mulund resident who fell victim to cybercrime in 2013 after a duplicate of his SIM card was allegedly issued to another person.
Chandrakant Soni, the complainant, said that he had a savings account with a private bank and that his Vodafone mobile number was registered to receive alerts for transactions on this account.
His advocate Prashant Mali, told the adjudicating officer ofMaharashtra’s Directorate of Information Technology that on November 25, 2013 he had approached the telecom company with a complaint of poor connectivity. The company, he said, informed him that the service was active from their end. On November 27, Soni approached a Vodafone gallery at Churchgate where he was given a new SIM card after providing a copy of his PAN card.
Two days later, he noticed two transactions amounting to Rs 4.5 lakh on November 25 made without his knowledge to two accounts, the complainant alleged.
Soni, informed the court that he did not receive any SMS informing him about the transaction. On checking with Vodafone, he was informed that a duplicate SIM card had been issued on his number on November 24 from the Santacruz gallery. AnFIRwas subsequently registered by the Mulund police following which the accused were arrested.
Following this the complainant approached the adjudicating officer against his bank and the mobile service provider. The complainant’s bank, one of the respondents in the case said that they had followed due procedure and that it was Vodafone that had violate norms of security while issuing the SIM card to a stranger.
Vodafone argued that the person who got the duplicate SIM card had produced a PAN card. After hearings were conducted, the adjudicating officer in his order remarked, “…the signature in the original documents submitted by the complainant and the ones submitted by the alleged fraudster do not match. They (Vodafone) didn’t even check if the number was in use and active or not. Vodafone has not been able to produce a proof for the SMS they claim to have sent to the number of the complainant for change of SIM card.”
The order went on to say, “ …because of the negligence of the KYC norms and telecom guidelines by respondent no 3 (Vodafone Essar) the money transfer was facilitated and as a consequence, a loss of Rs 4.5 lakh was caused to the complainant.” The officer then directed that the complainant be compensated Rs 4.5 lakh by Vodafone Essar within one month of the receipt of the order.
Vodafone Essar was not available for a comment.
Mali said, “This is a 2014 matter and as per The IT Act, 2000 the Adjudication Officer has to decide the matters before him in 6 months. I feel justice is delayed and the delayed justice would have been good if atleast the money was told to be returned with interests and cost. Returning only actual losses makes justice a costly affair for the complainants. Adjudication officer should have ordered to pay the money first and then appeal as the history has shown banks and telecom don’t pay and appeal the matter and the appeal takes another 2-3 years causing grave financial issues to the innocent complainant.”

"Demand for cyber insurance policies has gone up in the past few years, especially in the wake of the WannaCry ransomware attack of 2017 where computers using Microsoft Windows across the world were targeted by fraudsters, cyber experts said.
Recently,Pune-basedCosmos Bank lost Rs 94 crore in a coordinated digital fraudcomprising thousands of online transactions, made possible because of a malware attack on the bank’s systems.
Anurag Rastogi, member of executive management, HDFC ERGO General Insurance, said, “More corporates are opting for cyber security cover. Today, cyber risk has become an integral part of the boardroom discussion in most companies. In India, over 200 companies have already purchased it of which at least 50 per cent are purchasing the product year-on-year. In 2015, we wrote about 12 policies and by 2017 this number has grown by almost 90 per cent.”
Anup Dhingra, president of FINPRO & Private Equity M&A, Marsh India that deals with insurance broking and risk management, said, “The number of corporates opting for insurance cover has been on the rise since the last two years. From one policy in 2014-15, we have now around 230-250 standalone cyber policies in the market. The demand, which initially was from the IT segment, is now coming from all industry segments. After the ransomware attacks of 2017, demand for cyber insurance has seen a sharp rise.”
“Ransomware attacks and the ensuing losses are covered under a cyber liability insurance cover. The policy covers the ransom payment demand made by the hackers, forensic costs involved in figuring out the extent of damage, data restoration costs in the event of loss of encrypted data and further it can be extended to cover any business interruption loss due to operations being affected due to the ransomware attack,” he added.
Sasikumar Adidamu, chief technical officer, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance, said, “The company has seen more than 100 per cent increase in the first quarter of this financial year with respect to the number of cyber insurance policies sold in the same period last year. The number of enquiries has also gone up with a higher conversion rate that clearly indicates not just increasing curiosity in the corporates about a solution for cyber risks faced by them, but also an increasing importance being given to it by the corporates.”
Several banks and government institutions have also been targeted by fraudsters. Last month, a NaviMumbai-based hospital and hotel became targets of a ransomware attack.
Cyber expert Vicky Shah said, “One of the first cyber policies to come into effect was in 2006. However, when it comes to banks, it was after an RBI circular issued in July 2016 asking them to go for insurance that all of them complied.
While the Information Technology Act does not make it mandatory for people to opt for insurance, it does ask companies to follow reasonable security practices to avoid risks.”
Shah added, “There are cases where insurance policies are not settled as key points are not insured. In one case the company taking a cyber insurance had not taken a malware — malicious software — cover and it suffered an attack due to malware and was not compensated.”

"An engineering company in Mumbai along with its Canada-based client were targeted by cyber criminals, who made fraudulent transfers to the tune of over Rs 20 lakh from their accounts. According to Powai police that registered an FIR, this is a case of a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) scam, where fraudsters intercept the company’s communication, impersonate the hacked parties and get money transferred to their own accounts. No arrests have been made in the case as yet.
An officer linked to the case said the Chandivali-based company, which dealt in furnace and foundry equipment, had contacted a German company to supply them hardware related to crane parts in April this year. The company normally places orders through e-mail.
The firm contacted the German company in November last year. The two companies kept communicating through emails and in February this year, the Chandivali company placed an order for some crane parts. The German company confirmed the order and asked them to make an initial payment of 30 per cent of the total amount — 5,940 euros (Rs 4.89 lakh), an officer said.
The company made a payment of Rs 4.89 lakh in April and the rest of the payment of Rs 11.24 lakh in June this year. However, within a few weeks the complainant’s company received an invoice from the German company.
“Having made the payment already, the complainant was taken aback and informed the German company of having already made the payment. They were, however, informed that no such payment had been received. The German company further confirmed that the account number to which the payment had been made did not belong to them,” a senior officer said.
At this point the complainant checked the e-mail address that had sent them the account number and found that it did not belong to the German company.
“Since the e-mail address looked similar to that of the German company and they were already in communication with them, the complainant did not realise that the e-mail address had been changed. This is called e-mail spoofing wherein you make a minor change, like adding an alphabet, to an official ID and using it to cheat people,” the officer said. Spoofing is part of the MITM scam, whereby fraudsters intercept companies that have international dealings, spoof e-mail addresses and provide their own account number for payments to be made.
In this case, after the complainant realised about the fraud and checked the other account details, he found that a similar case had taken place with them in June.
In May, a Canada-based company got in touch with the complainant and placed an order for spare parts worth 8,120 Canadian dollars (Rs 4.33 lakh).
“In this instance, fraudsters had spoofed the email address of the Chandivali-based company, provided their own account number and got the Canada-based company transfer the amount to their own account instead of the Chandivali-based company,” the officer added.
After the complainant approached the Powai police last week, anFIRhad been registered on charges of cheating and relevant sections of the Information Technology Act.
“Normally in such cases tracking the accused is difficult as they use proxy networks. We are, however, trying to trace the bank account into which the money was fraudulently transferred,” the officer added.

"A woman who befriended a man on Facebook a few weeks ago got him arrested on March 22 after he allegedly tried to extort money from her by threatening to post her semi-nude photographs on social media. Police said the 24-year-old complainant, who is married and has a daughter, took the man to RAK Marg police station where a case of criminal intimidation and extortion was registered and he was arrested.
In her statement to the police, the woman has said that two months ago, she got a friend request onFacebookfrom somebody named Simran Shaikh, who then introduced her to a man named Prince K few weeks back. “As Shaikh and I had become good friends, I trusted her and accepted Prince’s request,” the complainant said. The man who went by the name Prince allegedly began sending messages to the complainant. They also shared phone numbers with each other. As they got closer, he reportedly began asking for her photographs. The complainant said initially she refused but later, she sent him some semi-nude pictures of herself on Facebook messenger.
Prince then claimed that he wanted to meet her. The woman refused but later, she met him near her Nerul house. After that, Shaikh allegedly called up the woman and demanded that she deposit Rs 10,000 in an account. Shaikh and Prince allegedly began threatening the woman saying they would send the photographs to her husband and other relatives. Prince allegedly even threatened to post her semi-naked photographs on social media.
“I called up a friend and asked him for help. We called Prince and under the pretext of giving him the money he had asked for, I asked him to meet me near Sewri court. We asked two of our friends to accompany us,” said the complainant. The woman waited for Prince near Sewri court while her friends stood at a distance. The accused came on his bike and asked the complainant to sit on the bike. Before he could start the bike, the woman’s three friends got hold of him and took him to the nearest police station at RAK Marg.
A case was registered under sections 385 (putting person in fear of injury in order to commit extortion), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code, along with sections 66 (E) and 84 of the Information Technology Act. The arrested accused has been identified as Shahnawaz Mohomed Dinkhan (30), a Sewri resident.
Senior Police Inspector, RAK Marg police station, Bhagwat Bhansod said: “We are on the lookout for his accomplice Simran Shaikh. We are also checking if he has any other cases pending against him.”

"Home Minister Rajnath Singh Wednesday said cyber crime has become an industry globally and that such offences may occur “very often” due to the availability of resources in wrong hands. Singh also said penetration of Internet and self-radicalisation have further added to the woes of law enforcement agencies and that continuance of the availability of radicalised materials on Internet is likely to have drastic change in society and subsequently to humanity.
Inaugurating a two-day Asia-Pacific regional conference of the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) on “Challenges to Policing in 2020- How is Cyber Space shaping our approach to Cyber crime & Terrorism, how do we perform within it and take advantage of it”, the home minister said cyber security network outages, data compromised by hackers, computer malware and other cyber-related incidents and crimes have affected people’s lives.
“I am afraid, cyber attack would occur very often. Tools already exist to mount cyber attacks and they will be improving over the next decade. We have already witnessed an increase in the number and severity of such attacks,” he said.
Singh said cyber crime has become an industry and many cyber crimes-related tools and techniques are being offered as services. Even novice criminal with limited investments of money can afford to have such services at his disposal.
“The increase in digitisation of the financial services with inadequate attention to setting up of robust process, controls and monitoring mechanisms has given new age fraudsters the opportunity to exploit these gaps leading to new types of financial crimes,” he said.
The home minister said the new age technologies such as the internet of things, virtual currencies, advanced malware, artificial intelligence, etc. are fast spreading its tentacles. The police are now expected to cope with such rapid changing technologies, as well.
“Across many countries many cyber criminals uses technologies like darknet, proxy servers, The Onion Router (TOR) services to hide their identity. Extensive use of VolP, caller ID spoofing, use of crypto currencies, encrypted channel for communication, use of social media have virtually created syndicates of criminals irrespective of their nationality,” he said.
Singh said in the fast changing technology world, computer-based technologies are being increasingly used in various activities ranging from simple home security system to complex nuclear power plants or space programs.
“The cyber-dependency has become widespread today. This has increased vulnerability to attacks against both civilian and military infrastructures,” he said.
The home minister said the governments, defence forces, corporations, financial institutions, utility services, hospitals and other businesses collect, process and store a great deal of sensitive information on systems and transmit data across networks.
“With the growing volume and sophistication of cyber attacks, each one of us is required to protect sensitive information, as well as safeguard national security,” he said.
Singh said there are many risks, some more serious than others, like viruses, computer hacking, pilferage of data, stealing of credit card information, etc.
“Unfortunately, there is no 100 per cent guarantee that even with the best precautions some of these things won’t happen to you, but there are steps you can take to minimize the chances,” he said.

"A 23-year-old management trainee working in a leading bank was allegedly cheated of  Rs 1.56 lakh after unidentified people got hold of her debit card details and blocked SMS alerts to her phone. The police said that the fraudsters could also change her pin number.
Borivali resident Sonal Maheshwari told the police that she discovered the theft when she checked her email account and found that Rs 1.56 lakh had been withdrawn from her bank account without her knowledge.
Sonal rushed to a nearby ATM and tried to use her debit card but found that her PIN had been changed. Through her bank statement, Sonal learnt that a total of 14 transactions had been made from her account between February 7 and March 1.
An officer from Kasturba Marg police station said, “Maheshwari had a registered mobile number with the bank to get immediate updates on her mobile about any transaction, but she never got the SMS alerts for these withdrawals. We believe that the culprits changed her registered mobile number.”
The Kasturba Marg police have registered a case under sections 419 (cheating by impersonation) and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of the Indian Penal Code along with relevant sections of the IT Act.

"A Russian man accused of operating a network of infected computers used by cyber criminals has been extradited to the United States from Spain and will make an initial court appearance on Friday, the US Department of Justice said.
US prosecutors said Peter Levashov, 37, ran the Kelihos botnet, a network of more than 100,000 infected devices used by cyber criminals to distribute viruses, ransomware, phishing emails and other spam attacks.
Levashov denies the charges in an eight-count indictment handed down by a federal grand jury in Connecticut in April.
Levashov, who fought the extradition, told Spain's High Court in September that he had worked for Russian President Vladimir Putin's United Russia party for the last 10 years, Russia's RIA news agency reported.
He told the court that investigators in the United States would torture him for information about his political work if he was sent there to face the charges, RIA said.
Levashov was charged by US prosecutors with causing intentional damage to a protected computer and wire fraud, which carry a potential prison sentence of up to 52 years if he is convicted at trial.
He was arrested while on holiday in Barcelona last April and in October, Spain's High Court granted a US request to extradite him. Levashov was scheduled to appear in court in Bridgeport, Connecticut, the Justice Department said.

However, even after the fraud came to Shah’s notice, a friend transferred Rs 1 lakh to the bank account mentioned in the email.
The police said that in the last week of December last year, a person posing as Shah sent emails to his family members and friends seeking monetary assistance for a friend whose daughter needed an urgent surgery. The email added that Shah was unable to help as he was abroad at that time.
When the receivers contacted Shah, they were informed that he had not sent out such a message and the email address did not belong to him. But one of Shah’s friends transferred money to a bank account number mentioned in the email.  SouthMumbairesident Shah filed a complaint with Gamdevi police station last week alleging that an unidentified person had created a fake email address and solicited funds in his name. The police have registered a case of impersonation and cheating under the Indian Penal Code and identity theft under the Information Technology Act against an unidentified person.

"Intensifying the fight against cyber crime, networking giant Cisco and international police organisation Interpol on Tuesday announced an agreement to share threat intelligence. The alliance will see the two organisations develop a coordinated and focused approach to data sharing, Cisco said in a statement.
This not only will allow for quick threat detection around the world but also pave the way for potential future collaboration on training and knowledge sharing, it added. “The exchange of information and expertise between the public and private sectors is vital in combating cyber crime. No country or company can do this alone,” said Noboru Nakatani, Executive Director of the Interpol Global Complex for Innovation (IGCI) in Singapore, which serves as Interpol’s global cyber crime centre.
“Interpol’s agreement withCiscoprovides us, and law enforcement in our 192 member countries, with access to important cyber threat information which will help us not only detect attacks but also help prevent them,” Nakatani added. Cisco said it blocks 19.7 billion threats a day through its Collective Security Intelligence, enabled by Cisco Talos, the security intelligence and research group.
Its agreement with Interpol supports the organisation’s programmes targeting both “pure cyber crime” and cyber-enabled crimes to assist member countries with identifying cyber attacks and their perpetrators. “As cyber crime continues to escalate around the world, defenders from both the public and private sectors must meet the threat with equal force,” said John Stewart, Senior Vice President and Chief Security and Trust Officer at Cisco.
Visibility and comprehensive threat intelligence across the cyber domain are critical to enable detection, analysis and protection against emerging threats,” Stewart added.

"A phone call for a credit card, a barrage of international calls, and extortion messages for Chinese Yuan in bitcoin. By the end of the ordeal, Dinesh Arora (60), an electronics goods store owner in Khan Market, got one final message on his smartphone: “You have exceeded your bank limit”.
Arora was a victim of a coordinated cyber attack in which he lost Rs 1,37,000. Five months after the attack, police are yet to make headway in the case and suspect that it was carried out by a group of criminals. AnFIRin the case was finally lodged on October 3.
Arora said he was first contacted by a caller, who introduced himself as a customer care executive from a bank offering him a credit card. “I thought he was a genuine employee as the Truecaller app also showed the bank’s name. He convinced me to give out my credit card andAadhaar carddetails,” he said.
The first signs of the fraud were found when Arora started receiving extortion messages. “Send me 1,100 chinese yuan thru bitcoin. If no send by then ur cell phone, laptop, iPad, tablet, SIM in problem (sic),” the message read.
Soon after, Arora said he received over 130 international calls. “When I would pick up, nobody would answer,” he said.
Arora then reached out to his telecom service provider and also filed a police complaint.
A few days later, he received a call from a man posing as a customer care executive from the service provider. He asked Arora to swap his iPhone with anAndroidto stop receiving calls and messages. After five days, when he switched back, he found a message from his bank, informing him that he had exceeded his bank limit and that his savings had been wiped out.

"In view of the growing incidents of financial cyber crimes, including frauds using cards and e-wallets, Home Minister Rajnath Singh has ordered strengthening of the surveillance and legal frameworks to check the menace, the home ministry said today. The issue came up at a high-level meeting where the strategies being adopted to check financial cyber crimes were discussed in detail.
Representatives from various agencies made presentations and appraised the home minister of the current trends of financial cyber crimes in the country and the steps being taken by their agencies to address this challenge, a home ministry spokesperson said.

"The cyber crime unit of the Criminal Investigations Department of the Karnataka police have arrested two foreigners – a Hungarian and a Romanian national – for rigging several bank ATMs in the city and capturing the ATM card data and pin numbers of unsuspecting ATM users. The two arrested men have been identified as Dan Sabin Christian, 40, from Romania and Mare Janos, 44, from Hungary who arrived in India for the first time on a tourist visa on September 1 and were due to leave on September 19.
The modus operandi employed by the two East Europeans to steal the card data of ATM users in Bengaluru bears a striking resemblance to the tactics employed by a Romanian gang involved last year in the stealing of data at ATMs in Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala. In the Kerala case one of the suspects Gabriel Marian, 27, was arrested inMumbaidays after a few victims in Kerala complained of illegal debits of funds from their accounts. The investigations in the case had shown that the Romanians had planted card skimmers and pin cameras at ATMs to capture the data of users in order to clone the cards.
The cyber crime unit of the CID inKarnatakain the investigations of their case have found that the two persons arrested in Bengaluru this week planted skimmers on eight occasions in five ATMs in the central business district and at an ATM at the international airport. The operations of the duo were unearthed by the police after officials of the Kotak Mahindra Bank reported that illegal devices for skimming ATM cards and capturing pin numbers had been found at the bank’s ATM kiosk on MG Road in the CBD.
Based on this information and the CCTV footage of the persons who installed the skimmer and mini camera the cyber crime police carried out investigations and found that similar equipment was also installed at a Kotak Mahindra ATM at the international airport. The police laid a trap for the suspects and waited for them to arrive to retrieve the devices.
Following the arrest the two foreign nationals have claimed that they are part of an organized criminal gang working with an operator based in the UK. “The duo brought sophisticated equipment with them and planted it in the ATMs as part of an operation to gather data of as many ATM users as possible in order to later monetize it,” the director general of the CID H C Kishore Chandra said. The duo were earlier caught in Jamaica for a similar offence, the official said. “No money has been stolen with the data theft in Bengaluru but we are asking the banks to alert customers who have used the ATMs where the skimmers were installed to change their pin and other details, ” the additional director general of police at the CID Prathap Reddy said. The duo planted the skimmers in the early hours of the morning and would retrieve them late at night to change the memory cards which stored the stolen data. The stolen data would be transmitted in an encrypted form to the associate in the UK who would use the data to grab funds from the accounts of victims for purchases and cash.
The CID would initiate proceedings against the main operators of the card skimming gang through the Interpol, ADGP Prathap Reddy said.
The ATMs compromised in the card data theft by the two foreign nationals over the last two weeks are – the Kotak Mahindra ATMs at the Bengaluru International Airport and the Trinity Metro Station, a Citibank ATM at the Garuda Mall, a Canara Bank ATM at M G Road, and a Kotak bank ATM at Brigade Road. According to the CID the duo have been travelling around the world and have visited the US, Mexico, Guatemala, Jamaica, Philippines, France, Argentina and
Uruguay in recent times. The police said they are verifying linkages to the gang involved in the ATM skimming in Kerala last year. Cristian and Janos were scheduled to fly to the UK on September 19.
A Citi Bank spokesperson said, “Security of our customer information is of paramount importance to Citi. To the best of our understanding, there has been no compromise of any customer data due to this fraudulent activity as on date, and we shall continue to take all possible steps to safeguard our customers’ interests. We are closely monitoring the situation and co-operating with the law enforcement agency on this incident.”

"A 70-YEAR-OLD woman became the latest victim of the ‘vishing’ fraud where conmen pretending to be calling from banks take debit card or bank account details of unsuspecting people and make fraudulent transactions using them. In the current case, Vrushali Joglekar, a Malad resident, lost Rs 1.25 lakh in a series of unauthorised transactions made within an hour using her internet banking details. The Malad police registered an FIR Monday and are investigating the matter.
According to the police, Joglekar, who retired from a private sector job a few years ago, lives along with her 75-year-old husband Vighyan in their sixth floor home in Ankur Cooperative Housing Society at Jubilee Park in Malad, and the two survive on their pension money.
On August 20, around 4.30 pm, Joglekar was at home when she received a call from a man who claimed to be calling from the IDBI bank where the senior citizen held an account, said the police. In her complaint to the police, Joglekar said, “The person who called me claimed that my bank account had been deactivated and would need my account details to reactivate it. Not suspecting anything amiss, I gave away by bank account details.”
Joglekar soon suspected there was something wrong. She then went to the local branch of her bank to check her balance. The balance seemed much lower than what she had expected. She went to the main branch the next day and found that 18 unauthorised transactions had been carried out on her bank account. “A total of Rs 1,25,978 had been withdrawn illegally in the 18 transactions made on her account using internet banking,” said an officer from the Malad police station.
After realising that she had been duped, Joglekar and her husband approached the Malad police station, where a case was registered for cheating and under relevant sections of the Information Technology Act. An officer linked to the probe said, “We are trying to trace the number from which the call had been made. We have also sought some details from the bank using which we should be able to track down the accused.”
A senior officer said, “In a large number of vishing cases, the victims are senior citizens who are not tech savvy. There have been a spurt of such vishing cases in the northern suburbs of the city where people have lost money to such fraudsters.”

"Here’s another reason to be leery of the initial coin offerings being done at a staggering pace in the cryptocurrency world: there’s a one-in-10 chance you’ll end up a victim of theft. Phishing scams have helped push up criminal losses to about $225 million this year, according to Chainalysis, a New York-based firm that analyzes transactions and provides anti-money laundering software. In such scams, investors are tricked into sending money to internet addresses pretending to be funding sites for digital token offerings related to the Ethereum blockchain technology.
More than 30,000 people have fallen prey to Ethereum-related cyber crime, losing an average of $7,500 each, with ICOs amassing about $1.6 billion in proceeds this year, Chainalysis estimates. “It’s a huge amount of money to generate in such a short period of time,” said Jonathan Levin, co-founder of Chainalysis, whose software and database are used by some of the largest bitcoin companies and U.S. law enforcement agencies. “The cryptocurrency phishers are doing pretty good against all the other types of criminals that are out there.”
Indeed, the huge amount of wealth that has fallen prey to cyber criminals is approaching the losses incurred by robberies in the U.S. for the entire year of 2015, which stood at $390 million, according to statistics released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. ICOs are digital token sales typically that raise ether, with users transferring the funds to addresses provided by startups. Investors, sometimes eager to get early access to new token offerings have been tricked into providing their credentials to fake websites through targeted email campaigns, twitter posts and Slack messages, said Levin.
Most attacks involve creating websites or social media accounts that sound similar to the real ICO project. Levin gave the fictional example of a project named “illuminate,” which an imposter might fake by spelling it as “iIIuminate.” Using the fake account, they would solicit potential investors to send money to the criminal’s address. His firm compiled the data by identifying so-called digital wallets used by scam artists. That information is usually public because criminals widely circulate it, hoping to fool investors into sending them money.
Other common forms of crime involve tapping into project loopholes. The DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization, is a smart contract project built on top of Ethereum that was intended to democratize how Ethereum projects are funded. A bug in the system was exploited and that led to the theft of $55 million worth of ether at the time. Levin didn’t provide data for bitcoin-related cybercrime, and not because it is any safer. He said such data is harder to track as scams are usually specific attacks on individual holders, rather than ICO-related campaigns which try to dupe many people at once.
“The overall figures mean there are infrastructure that we need to build to help prevent people from getting abused,” said Levin.

He asked officers to train their sub-ordinates to accept driving licences saved in digital form in mobile phones. “Today a motor vehicle driver can keep licence in digital form. Digital form means in his mobile phone. As an SP, you have to educate your darogas (inspectors) if they stop someone midway and ask for a licence, they should accept digital licence,” Prasad said.
The minister said that he received a complaint from a motor vehicle owner that he was fined by policemen even after showing licence in digital format. He, however, cautioned police officers from using finger print and iris scans for ordinary policing.

"Over 55 per cent of millennials (born between 1980-2000) in India have experienced cybercrime in the past year and globally, millennials are the most commonly affected victims, with 40 per cent experiencing it last year, a report revealed on Saturday.
According to the ‘Norton Cyber Security Insights’ report by security software firm Norton by Symantec, “39 per cent Indian millennials have either experienced ransomware themselves or know someone who has”.
“Millennials emerged as the password sharing generation in India with 34 per cent of them admitting to sharing passwords of various accounts,” said Ritesh Chopra, Country Manager, Norton by Symantec, in a statement. Of those who have experienced ransomware, 80 per cent of the millennial victims did so in the past one year alone.
Further, 18 per cent of millennial victims paid the ransom, yet, did not gain access to their files, the findings showed. When it comes to Wi-Fi usage, 30 per cent millennials agreed to have used their neighbour’s Wi-Fi network without their permissions, compared to 22 per cent of the overall respondents.
While overall, one in four consumers regularly use public Wi-Fi connections available at airports, coffee and shops, this rises to 33 per cent among millennials.
Putting their cyber security at risk, 60 per cent of these millennials are willing to give into actions such as answering a survey question, install a third-party app (43 per cent), provide access to files while online (25 per cent) and turn off their security software (24 per cent) to gain access to free public Wi-Fi.
Read:US concerned over Russia blocking access to LinkedIn
In order to protect your information, Norton recommends these practices — avoid password promiscuity, do not pay the ransom and backup, be in control when online, know the ins and outs of public Wi-Fi networks — to millennials.
The Norton report is an online survey of 20,907 device users ages 18+ across 21 markets, commissioned by Norton by Symantec and produced by research firm Edelman Intelligence.

"Hours before the Federal Reserve Bank of New York approved four fraudulent requests to send $81 million from a Bangladesh Bank account to cyber thieves, the Fed branch blocked those same requests because they lacked information required to transfer money, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter.
On the day of the theft in February, the New YorkFedinitially rejected 35 requests to transfer funds to various overseas accounts, a New York Fed official and a senior Bangladesh Bank official told Reuters. The Fed’s decision to later fulfill a handful of resubmitted requests raises questions about whether it missed red flags.
The New York arm of the US central bank initially denied the transfer requests because they lacked proper formatting for the SWIFT messaging system, the network banks use for international financial transfers, the two officials said. The Bangladesh Bank official said they lacked the names of correspondent banks, which typically receive wired funds. The Fed rejected the requests, which came from hackers who had broken into the SWIFT network through Bangladesh Bank systems.
[related-post]
Later in the day, however, the cyber thieves resubmitted those 35 requests. On the second try, the messages had the proper formatting, the New York Fed official said. The requests had been authenticated by SWIFT, the first line of defense against fraudulent wire transfers. Despite the technical compliance, the New York Fed rejected 30 of the requests a second time. But the Fed did approve five requests – for a total of $101 million. Later, one of those five transfers – a $20 million request – was reversed because of a misspelling.
The New York Fed has said it blocked the 30 resubmitted requests because they were flagged for economic sanctions review. Only afterward were they deemed potentially fraudulent. The Bangladesh Bank official and another source close to the bank said the New York Fed should have rejected all the requests on both the first and second attempts.
The source close to the bank, who also had direct knowledge of the matter, said anomalies in the four transfers that ultimately went through should have raised questions at the New York Fed. They were paid to individual recipients, a rarity for Bangladesh’s central bank, and the false names on the four approved withdrawals also appeared on some of the 30 resubmitted requests rejected by the bank, said the source close to the Bangladesh Bank.
“Of course, we asked the Fed why the repetition of the names did not create red flags,” the source said. “They are saying they rejected 35 badly submitted ones,” the source said. But when the requests were re-submitted, they “paid 5 of them and stopped 30. Why? They can give no answer.” Bangladesh Bank and SWIFT declined to comment.
The New York Fed has said there were no problems with its procedures for approving SWIFT fund transfers, and declined to comment on whether it missed any warning signs. The cyber theft from Bangladesh’s central bank – and recent disclosures of other similar fraud attempts – have brought scrutiny on the SWIFT messaging system.
SWIFT is a cooperative of global banks formally known as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, and its transaction system was used as a conduit for one of the largest cyber bank heists in history.
In the United States, a congressional committee has launched a probe into the New York Fed’s role in the bank heist. The Bangladeshi central bank might seek compensation for the funds from theFederal Reserve, and Bangladesh Bank police have said that recent installation of a new SWIFT settlement system at the bank last fall may have provided thieves an opportunity to gain access to the bank’s SWIFT servers.
RED FLAGS?
The New York Fed’s reviews of payment requests that come over the SWIFT system are focused chiefly on guarding against money laundering and transfers to people and entities that are under U.S. government sanctions, Fed officials have said. But requests often also are temporarily halted to fix typos and other formatting problems.
The Fed branch has said its clients, including Bangladesh Bank, and SWIFT have primary responsibility for preventing unauthorized transfers. Fed employees queried Bangladesh Bank about the purpose of the payments requested on Feb. 4 and again on Feb. 5, according to a letter to congresswoman Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) by New York Fed General Counsel Thomas Baxter.
The four transfers totaling $81 million went to accounts in the Philippines.
The money wound up with casinos and casino agents and remains missing. An attempt to transfer $20 million to a foundation in Sri Lanka was reversed because the word “foundation” was misspelled.
The source close to Bangladesh Bank said questions about the anomalies in the approved requests were discussed at a meeting in Basel last month between New York Fed President William Dudley, Bangladesh Bank Governor Fazle Kabir and representatives from SWIFT. Rep. Maloney and Tom Carper, the top Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security Committee, both have made inquiries to the New York Fed.
The House Science Committee informed the New York Fed in a letter this week that it is launching a probe into its handling of the transfer requests. The committee plans to examine the New York Fed’s response to the heist, the oversight of SWIFT, and whether additional measures are needed to address vulnerabilities to cyber attacks. SWIFT, which has come under scrutiny after the Bangladesh Bank heist and cyber attacks in at least three other cases, plans a new program to improve security and also wants banks to “drastically” improve information sharing.

"INVESTIGATION into a case of online fraud in which a Kothrud resident was duped on the pretext of receiving loan, has led the city cyber crime cell to bust an illegal call centre in Delhi and arrest two persons who have cheated as many as 60 persons across India to the tune of Rs 65 lakh by luring them on the same pretext.
The cyber crime cell was investigating a case filed by a Kothrud resident, Satish More, who was cheated to the tune of Rs 45,000 by callers, who approached him in April. The first caller, who identified himself as Aman Varma, told More that the call was on behalf of a reputed bank and that More was eligible for a loan of Rs 15 lakh. In the next couple of weeks, More received several calls asking for his bank details and personal information. In some of the calls, the callers who identified themselves with various names, asked him to pay money as processing fee for the loan. More was asked to make these payments electronically to certain account numbers.
[related-post]
On May 19, More approached Kothrud police after he realised that he had been cheated. AFirst Information Reportwas registered under Indian Penal Code section for cheating and relevant sections of Information Technology Act. The Cyber Crime Cell immediately started probe into the case.
During investigation, the police team got the details of an account number in the name of one Sonu Singh, with a Delhi address of a call centre.
A team from the Cyber crime cell was sent to Delhi and based on the address given for the bank account and other clues, police reached the call centre in Tilak Nagar area in New Delhi and arrested Sonu Singh (25), who is originally from Panipat in Haryana. The probe led the police to Raman Ranjindar Negi (21), a resident of Subhash Nagar in Delhi and an accomplice of Singh. Police said that the call centre was being run illegally.
Deputy commissioner of police (Cyber Crime and Economic Offences Wing) Deepak Sakore said, “As per our primary probe, the two suspects till now have cheated 55 to 60 persons from across India for over Rs 65 lakh. Of these, as many as 11 are fromMaharashtra.” Police have urged citizens to come forward, if they have been cheated on the same pretext and if they have not yet approached the police.

"The Cyber Cell of Pune city police has arrested a conman who allegedly duped many persons by falsely claiming to be a private detective.
Culprit Sagar Ashok Pandit, a resident of Keshav Nagar in Pimpri, and his Delhi-based accomplice had floated advertisements of a private detective service agency on social media and Justdail service.
They claimed to have software using which it was possible to record cell phone calls, trace locations of callers, read the messages and other information in the cell phones secretly. They also offered services like surveillance, gathering information about extramarital affairs.
[related-post]
According to the police, a few days ago, Jagganath Chowdhary, a resident of Chandan Nagar, got to know about this detective agency from Justdail. When he contacted the agency, he was asked to pay Rs 50,000 for the detective services. But Chowdhary demanded the software used for secretly recording phone calls after paying Rs 11,000. He also paid Rs 4,000 to the agency but never got any software.
So he lodged a complaint with Chandan Nagar police station.
Meanwhile, the Cyber Cell also received an anonymous complaint regarding fake private detective agency attracting customers through social media. It then initiated a probe and arrested Pandit on Wednesday evening.
Police found that Pandit’s aide based in Delhi is the mastermind and has cheated several persons to the tune of Rs 6 lakh.
Police have launched a search for Pandit’s accomplice. Meanwhile, Pandit was handed over to the Chandan Nagar police station for further investigation.

"Three days after the inauguration of Uttar Pradesh’s first Centre for Cyber Crime Investigation (CCCI) in Noida, Gautam Budh Nagar Police arrested two former call centre employees in a case of alleged financial fraud Thursday.
The arrests were made on the basis of a complaint by a man who had allegedly been duped of Rs 7 lakh on the promise of an interest-free loan.
“The complainant, Ganesh Shanker Choudhary, approached the cyber cell and said he had received a call from a person who claimed to be a representative of IRDA. The caller told Choudhary he would receive an interest-free loan of Rs 30 lakh. The complainant started getting calls from other numbers with the same offer. He then deposited nearly Rs 7 lakh as processing fee in a bank account, as per instructions given to him by these callers,” said Dinesh Yadav, superintendent of police (city), Gautam Budh Nagar, who is also heading the team at CCCI.
[related-post]
“Choudhary did not receive any loan money and he demanded that the amount submitted by him should be returned. At that point, he received an e-mail which had scanned copies of two bank drafts — one was a Canara Bank draft worth Rs 11,50,000 and the other was a Bank of India draft for Rs 15,09,999. When the complainant showed these drafts to the banks concerned, he was told they were fake. That’s when he realised he had been duped,” said Yadav.
On the basis of bank account numbers mentioned in the drafts as well as mobile surveillance, two persons — Mohit Choudhary and Amitesh Kirti — were arrested from Noida’s Sector-3 area Thursday, said police.
While Mohit Choudhary is a resident of Bijnor, Amitesh Kirti hails from Ghaziabad.
“They would take up jobs in call centres, steal details of customers and then quit their jobs. Using these details, they would call various customers, offer them false incentives and convince them to transfer money to their accounts,” said Yadav.
He added, “Transaction details of Mohit Choudhary’s account show that in the last one year, he accumulated over Rs 17 lakh. Both of the accused are currently unemployed. We are going through their account transactions. It is possible that they have duped many others of crores of rupees.”
AnFIRunder IPC Section 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) and Section 66 of the Information Technology Act has been registered at Noida Sector 20 police station.

"The official website of Odisha’s oldest university, Utkal University, was Tuesday hacked for the second time in a week forcing officials to shut down the e-admission process.
Although it wasn’t clear if the hackers stole any information, the website was defaced and the page showed a group called ‘Pak Cyber Attackers’ to be responsible for the attack.
Vice Chancellor Ashok Das said his officials deactivated the server after the website was found vandalised.

"On the first floor of a building in Noida’s Sector 6, a team of 10 sits behind workstations. While some examine a black suitcase hooked to wires, others look at a screen attached to a smaller device.
With four cubicles devoted to email tracking, data acquisition and recovery, social media investigation and mobile phone surveillance, this is the Centre for Cyber Crime Investigation (CCCI) —Uttar Pradesh’s first cyber crime centre which will be inaugurated Monday. With around 780 cases of cyber crime reported in Noida in 2015, this cell has been equipped with state-of-the-art tools to tackle cases related to financial fraud, data theft, social media crimes among others.
“In cases of cyber crimes, techniques used for preventing, solving and analysing traditional crimes are not of much help. The manner in which these crimes take place and the material recovered in such cases are different from regular crimes. Most of this material is in digital form and one needs specific hardware and software for analysing it,” said Dinesh Yadav, SP City, Noida.
[related-post]
Yadav will lead a team of 10 members at CCCI. Elaborating on the social media investigation section, Yadav said his team will look at crimes related to platforms likeFacebookand Twitter.
“A huge portion of cyber crimes committed on social media target women. Several times, such complaints are not filed with police. We do not reveal the identity of the complainant and using advanced software tools, we will tackle cases,” he said.
Pointing to a disk imaging tool at the Data Acquisition and Recovery Section, Yadav said the equipment will help police “create images of the hard disk before its data is examined forensically” — a crucial step in using digital evidence in courts.
“The data acquisition and recovery section is the most crucial where all forensic tools are used… A separate forensic tool for mobile phones has also been procured. A lot of financial fraud cases come to us where a person’s email account is misused. We are equipped to track the origin of such e-mails,” Yadav added.
615 cases of financial fraud reported in 2015
Last year on September 18, a resident of Gautam Budh Nagar received a phone call informing him that he had been shortlisted for a contest. The caller, claiming to be from a web portal, asked the man to register for the next level of the contest online. While directing him through the registration process, the caller was able to obtain his bank account details and duped him of nearly Rs 2 lakh.
This was one of around 615 cases of financial fraud which came to Gautam Budh Nagar police in 2015. With the Centre for Cyber Crime Investigation (CCCI) being inaugurated Monday, police said they would be better equipped to handle such cases.
“Last year, money looted through cyber crime frauds amounted to Rs 5 crore. Of this, we managed recover Rs 47 lakh and seal 40 fake call centres. With the help of advanced tools, we will be able to solve cases faster,” said Dinesh Yadav, SP City, Noida.

An officer said the victim, who was looking for a job, had applied on a well known job portal. After checking his details on the portal, accused Bhanupratap Singh ( 25) called him up claiming to be representing a company looking for people. Singh told the victim he would need to pay a fee before he could be called in for an interview. Over the past few weeks, the accused took a total of Rs 94,000 from the victim, said the police.
When the accused stopped responding, the victim realised he had been duped and then approached the cyber crime police station in Bandra Kurla Complex where anFIRwas registered. Based on the probe, the police tracked down the accused to Delhi and placed him under formal arrest on Wednesday.

"Amidst looming concerns over internet security, Minister of Communications and IT Ravi Shankar Prasad has reiterated India’s support for a multi-stakeholder model for internet governance, where the government will play the role of safeguarding internet security. Speaking to Sandeep Singh and Anil Sasi, Prasad said that India has emerged a powerful voice in internet governance and that incrementally, governments across the world are realising the threat of terrorism and are open to government’s role on security front. Edited excerpts:
What is India’s stand on internet governance?
At the ICANN Summit at Marrakech in Morocco, I reiterated India’s support to multi-stakeholder model for governing internet. Till now, the internet was governed by the Ministry of Commerce, USA, but their contract expires at the end of September. Now there is discussion on what should be the new architecture to govern the Internet.
While the question has been whether to go for multilateral or multi-stakeholder model, India has supported the latter. The multilateral model calls for one country-one vote and India sits with a group of countries, whereas in the multistakeholder model, academia, private parties, NGOs and government’s have a say. Within that, India will stand as a powerful voice as it is a big democracy with more than a billion people. Our stand has been that on matters relating to national security, government will continue to have supreme right and control. India’s eloquent and effective intervention has added a serious dimension to the ongoing transition process and the role of government in internet and cyber security.
[related-post]
How was India’s position chalked out?
A committee including defence minister Manohar Parrikar, railway minister Suresh Prabhu and me was constituted to take a final call and we took a decision to go with the multi-stakeholder model. It is also important to note that it was for the first time that such a high-level delegation went (for the ICANN meet in Marrakesh, Morocco earlier this month). Alongside with me and my officials, we had the deputy NSA Arvind Gupta and chief of cyber security Gulshan Rai in the delegation.
What about the government’s role in the framework of internet governance?
Terrorism is a big issue all over the world and the use of information and communication technology (ICT) has been a major cause of concern. We instinctively believe that the internet has to be open, plural, inclusive and that access should be available without discrimination. To ensure its stability, it must also be secure and therefore while fully endorsing the multi-stakeholder model, the issue of security should also be in focus and that is an area where government has a very important role to play. If the internet is one of the finest creations of human mind, it ought not be allowed to be abused by few who unleash terror, cybercrime. Therefore, the role of government will continue to be relevant as a important stakeholder.
Has India’s view been accepted by other countries?
While we have maintained that governments must be in-charge of security as it is competent to do that, India’s stand was widely accepted and I see it as a great victory for India. India has taken a lead on various issues. Several countries including the representative from the US spoke to me and they agree with the looming threat of terrorism… The US has also appreciated India’s stand and is backing multistakeholder model and government’s role… It is important to note that in this looming terror threat, use of ICT is becoming a serious anxiety and naturally governments will have to play a role in sharing of information and cyber security issues.
What will be the role played by the NTIA?
ICANN was assigned the task to manage Internet by US Commerce Department’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration under a contract and that expires on September 30. While NTIA is moving out, they will pay a role of during the transition from existing framework to the new governance model.
What kind of security layers will be brought in by the governments?
Since it has to be done by September-end, regular meetings will happen and our officers would attend them. I have already conveyed that India’s representation must be there. As for the security layers are concerned, those are issues of detail on which the world needs to work together and where internet bodies need to exchange views on security. So greater co-operation is needed in preventing fringe elements from using ICT.
Has there been any reference to Indian regulators’ position on differential pricing?
On net neutrality we have taken a position and given a shape to it. I am certain that in times to come, people will discuss India’s position on differential pricing. India has become a leader in many of these issues. I am of the view that internet has to be open and in that it can’t be fast for some and slow for some. I have told Parliament about our commitment to non-discriminatory access. It must, however, be understood that pricing is individual to a particular country but internet governance is an international issue.

Sources inform that off late there have been several attempts to gather personal as well as official information on the internet and that several advisories are already in place not to share any information on an email which appears to be suspicious in nature.
A senior officer in Western Command informed that following the attempts by certain elements to befriend military personnel over social media platforms, a heightened alert over cyber security is in place.
“Such phishing emails make it clear that someone wants to get access to official email accounts in order to access the classified information which would be available in the email transactions. All officers and other ranks who handle such email accounts have been duly cautioned and in addition firewalls are being strengthened to prevent access or hacking,” he said.

"cyber criminals have a new target. Over the past few months, there has been a rise in the scamming of consumers who file complaints through online forums against companies, service providers for faulty products and services. Cyber criminals, who read up on the online complaints, call up the complainants pretending to be from the company, “pleading them to take the complaint off and ask for a settlement amount.” Within a few hours however, instead of receiving money to the ‘debit card account’, consumers find that more amount has been debited from their account.
Praful Kumar Padhi, 52, had deposited over Rs 2 lakh in an investment club last year. In December last year, he received a cheque for the interest on his investment. The cheque however bounced and he soon learnt that several other investors had also faced a similar problem. “After several complaints, we approached the consumer forum and registered a complaint against the card club, where the money was invested,” Praful’s son Srikant, who works in a shipping company, toldThe Indian Express.
Soon after registering the complaint mid January, they received a call from the investment club on January 15 that told them that their money would be returned within 24 hours. “They told us to give the debit card number and wait for 24 hours. But instead of receiving money, we lost Rs 25,000, after which we blocked the card. Or else we would have lost much more money,” Shrikant added.
Following this, the harrowed family began to run from the bank to the investment club and the police station. None of them seemed to be of much help.When we approached the Vinoba Bhave Nagar police station in Kurla, they just told us to give an application. They did not register anFIR. They asked us to approach the bank to claim the amount.
When we approached the bank, we were told that since it was our error they could not do anything about it. “We do not know whose fault it was. It is not our fault as we did not even get or give any One Time Password (OTP), which is normally required to make transactions,” the Kurla resident said.When contacted, an officer from the VB Nagar police station said that they would have to check the application. He added that normally in such cases the banks refund the amount.
An officer from the cyber police station said that they have recently registered a few cases and it is a new trend where people making online complaints have been defrauded by cyber criminals.
“If you have registered a complaint against a company online and you receive a call from them it seems like the most obvious thing. On top of that if the company is offering a settlement, the aggrieved customer is all the more keen to provide his details and end his agony.”
Last month in a similar case, a Thane resident had lost money after he complained about his car malfunctioning on a consumer forum website.
He soon received a call from ‘the car company’ asking his for bank details so that the money could be refunded to his account. However, like Padhi, he only ended up losing more money.

"IN NEARLY six years since the setting up of a dedicated police station for cyber offences, not a single case registered by the BKC cyber police station has ended in a judgment from a court of law. BKC police station is the nodal unit for registering cyber crime offences ever since 2009 when the police started registering cases under the Information Technology (IT) Act. As many as 507 cases are being investigated by this unit, and many are in the courts, but remain pending there.Now, the Mumbai Police has sent a proposal to the Maharashtra Home Department asking for two new courts to be set up to deal specifically with cyber crime offences. Currently, only one magistrate’s court hears cyber crime cases, in addition to hearing other offences under the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
An officer said that from 2009 to 2014, there were 229 cases registered by the BKC police station, followed by 278 cases in the current year. So far none of the cases, including the first cases of 2009, has even reached the trial stage.
“In some of the cases summons have been issued and charges have been framed. However, there has hardly been anything beyond that,” the officer said. The reason stated by the cyber police is that currently there is just the 37th Metropolitan Magistrate’s court that hears cases of cyber crime. “This court also hears custody pleas in all crime branch cases apart from petty offences. This results in delays for cyber crime cases that have been on the rise,” an officer said.DCP (Cyber Crimes) M Raj Kumar confirmed that there is no verdict even in cases registered by the cyber police station in 2009. “In order to solve this problem of overburdening, a proposal has been sent to theMaharashtraHome Ministry for setting up of two courts that would only deal in cases of cyber crime, in order to bring down the backlog,” Raj Kumar toldThe Indian Express.
Pankaj Bafna, a lawyer who specializes in cases of cyber crime, said that there was a tendency to give priority to cases under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) – specifically body offences – over cases of cyber crime. “On several occasions, judges are transferred within some time and they are not specifically trained in cyber crime laws. With IPC cases piling up, the cyber crime cases are relegated to the background,” Bafna said. “We had heard there were soon going to divide the workload of the court by allowing the local magistrate’s courts to hear cyber crime cases that take place in their locality. However, nothing has happened so far,” Bafna said.
An officer from the cyber police station while cyber crime is being given priority considering the rising number of cases, if the cases are not decided by the court, all their efforts may not amount to much.

"THE RISING cases of cyber crime in Mumbai have prompted the state government to undertake a slew of measures to deal with the growing menace.
While a Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) took charge at the Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) cyber police station recently, talks are on to also have a separate Deputy Inspector General (DIG)-rank officer to oversee probes in cyber crime cases.
Compared to other districts across the state,Mumbaitopped the list with a total of 637 cyber crime-related cases from January to September this year, with Solapur city a distant second with 126 cyber crime-related cases in the same period.
An official from theMaharashtrahome department said that while there is no “formal proposal” yet, talks are on for at least a DIG-rank officer to solely deal with cyber crime cases. Currently, the Additional Commissioner of Police (ACP), Crime – a DIG-rank post – also looks into cyber crime cases.
Additional Chief Secretary (Home) K P Bakshi said they want to ensure proper arrangements are in place to track and deal with cases of cyber crime and a senior supervisory officer will go a long way in helping them accomplish that. “The Maharashtra chief minister himself has taken keen interest and wanted to set a crime prevention system in place due to increasing cases of cyber crime,” Bakshi toldThe Indian Express.
Sources said the talks should not take more than a week before a decision is taken. “The current ACP crime post will continue, once the new post is approved,” an official said.
Last week, M Jaykumar was posted as DCP to solely look after cases of cyber crime. An IPS officer said that given the rise in cyber crime cases and the constantly evolving modus operandi used by cyber criminals, there is a need to ensure that the law enforcement agencies are up to the mark.
“Earlier, there were hardly any cases of cyber crime. Even the ones that took place earlier were primarily due to an error on the part of the victim. Now, however the cyber criminals have become shrewd and use modus operandi that could fool even people who are well versed with technology,” the officer said. In addition to this, the upgrade plans of the cyber police include having a separate cyber cell in the five regions of the Mumbai police.
The condition at the cyber police station, the main unit of the Mumbai Police dealing with cyber crime, however, remains overburdened with officers at times being assigned more than 50 cases. “Earlier, we would not register FIRs in all cases because of the limited staff. Now, however, we are registering FIRs in all cases to show the actual work done by the police station. We are hopeful that this will lead to more vacancies being authorised at the cyber police station,” the officer added.

"Cyber crime cases have shot up across the state in the past year. Still, since January 17 this year, not a single order pertaining to cyber offences has been passed by the state’s Information Technology (IT) secretary, who is the adjudicating officer in such matters.
In 2013, orders were passed in 47 cases by the IT secretary. In 2014, orders were passed in 18 cases while in the first 16 days of this year, 21 cases were resolved by the adjudicating officer. However, since then, there has been a lull, much to the despair of victims, who have lost money to cyber criminals.
Apart from seeking police investigation and criminal action in cases of fraud, victims can also avail a provision by which they appear before the state IT secretary, who adjudicates regarding monetary compensation from the service provider if the latter is proven to have been negligent.
An official from the state IT department confirmed that no order had been passed since the earlier Secretary Rajesh Agarwal’s last order on January 16. There are approximately 116 cases pending — including 62 from last year — and the pendency list keeps increasing because of the slow pace of hearings.
Agarwal was IT Secretary for nearly three years. Since his transfer, the portfolio has seen three secretaries come and go, an official from the IT department said. Of those, at least one official held the post as an additional charge. In September, V K Gautam was appointed the IT Secretary.
“In addition to being an adjudicating officer, the IT secretary has several tasks. Such short time spans or additional portfolios mean that adjudicating takes a back seat,” an official toldThe Indian Express.
Gautam said the initial two-three months are spent in understanding the department. “I took over in September and had one hearing in which three cases were heard,” he said. “I am currently in Nagpur for the state Assembly session. Since January however, the hearings will begin every Tuesday, which should bring down the pendency,” Gautam said.
Cyber lawyer Vicky Shah said that for a year, there has hardly been any hearing. “The whole purpose of having an adjudicating officer, a quasi-judicial authority, is to ensure that such cases are not stuck in civil courts for years. If even this starts taking as much time, the whole purpose of having such an adjudicating officer will be lost. It also affects the confidence of the person who has lost money,” Shah said.

"Manoj Kumar Singh was a commandant with the Jharkhand Armed Police’s 6th Battalion in Jamshedpur when his posting as Superintendent of Police in Jamtara came through in August. “Yeh Jamtara hai kya? What is it famous for?” he asked his friends. “They all told me, ‘Oh, Jamtara? Jamtara has cyber crime’,” he says.
To be fair to Jamtara, it has a railway station named Chittaranjan, but then the famed locomotive factory is across the border, inWest Bengal’s Asansol district. There’s little else in this Jharkhand district, the 19th most populated of the state’s 24 districts. Census 2011 says 58.7 per cent of the population had not worked over the past year and that 74 per cent of those who had had either been cultivators or agricultural labourers.
Into this vacuum came 3G. “We currently have the capability of monitoring only one cell tower at a time. The Airtel tower outside Kala Jharia village sees 3,000 outgoing calls a day, almost all of them to other states. It should be 700-800 at a normal tower,” says Sub-InspectorNitish Kumar, in-charge of the district’s technical cell.
But Kala Jharia and its surrounding areas are not “normal” anymore. By all estimates, an overwhelming number of calls that result in online transaction frauds are made from Jharkhand, almost all of them from Jamtara district. “My team is currently analysing over 2,000 phone numbers linked to call-centre fraud and 90 per cent of them originate in Jamtara,” says Triveni Singh, an additional superintendent of police with theUttar Pradeshpolice’s Special Task Force on cyber crime.
The National Crime Records Bureau’s reports are a poor place to go to understand the scale of operations in Jharkhand: the state’s 93 cyber crime cases pale in comparison to the 1,879 registered by theMaharashtraPolice in 2014. The NCRB does not categorise those arrested by their state, which makes Jharkhand look good. However, a spike of 257 per cent in reported cases in Jharkhand over the past year — onlyChandigarh, with 55 cases and a spike of 400 per cent over year 2013, tops Jharkhand — is an indication of what is happening in Jamtara.
In the last week of November, the Delhi Police busted a phishing scam, arresting Dhananjay Mandal, 24, in Delhi and visiting Jamtara to arrest Pappu Mandal, 21. In fact, the Delhi Police team went to Pappu’s home, pretending to be members of a prospective bride’s family. “But they got suspicious. So the police team tracked his mobile real-time and caught him,” says a villager who tipped off the police.

SI Nitish Kumar asks the vehicle to slow down as it enters Kasitanr village in Karmatar block. He points to a mango orchard on the outskirts of the village. “This is the headquarters of all the ‘bank managers’ in the locality,” he says, chuckling. Kasitanr has 3G connectivity, unlike a number of villages along the 11-km route from the Jamtara district headquarters.
For all the talk of cyber crime, the setting is pastoral. “They get together in the mornings, split into groups of two or three and sit amidst the bamboo to make calls,” says SP Manoj Kumar Singh. Those calls that you may have received from the “ATM headquarters” or “SBI main branch” were almost always made from under the shade of bamboo clumps in Jamtara. Loopholes in online transaction models have allowed conmen with limited education to devise a low-tech Do-It-Yourself scam that bleeds naive individuals, one transaction at a time.
In the case of Raj Kumar Singh of Rae Bareli, it was 24 transactions. He received a call on November 15, with the caller claiming to be a representative of the State Bank of India’sLucknowbranch. Singh, an ex-serviceman, said on the phone that he shared his 19-digit debit card number. Singh said that by the time he disconnected his call, his account — where the Army sends his pension — had been emptied of Rs 49,000 through 24 transactions made to e-wallets.Narayan Mandal, 21, was arrested in a case registered at the Karmatar police station on June 20 this year. The arrest report mentions “kabhi kabhi sharaab peena (an occasional drinker)” against the column for habits. Police seized an SIM card registered in someone else’s name and used that to obtain a confessional statement.
After his matriculation, Mandal, who is from Rampur village, started helping his father Ramchandra Mandal in the fields. Together they would earn Rs 8,000-10,000 a month. And then, two-and-a-half years ago, he began making calls.
In his confessional statement, Mandal says he used to obtain fake SIM cards and contact people, seeking details of their bank accounts. He claims to have earned “many lakhs” running the scam and says he used the money to build a new house. He goes on to name five others who were part of his team: Kishore Mandal, Ashok Mandal, Suman Mandal, Jitendra Mandal and Rohit Mandal.
Police responded with a slew of charges under the IT Act. While Narayan Mandal is still in remand, no other arrests have been made in the case.
There is no uniform modus operandi at work in Jamtara. The only common factor is a team of two youngsters, one with a basic mobile phone and the other, a smartphone. The basic phone is used to make the call even as the smartphone is on standby with an e-wallet opened. The caller identifies himself — anecdotally, State Bank of India users are vulnerable due to their sheer number and hence, phishing potential — and declares that the account is up for verification or expiry. Once the card details of the individual are entered, the transaction mostly requires a One Time Password (OTP) to authenticate. At this point, the caller tells his prey that he has sent across a code for him to repeat to him. Once the caller reads out the number, the transaction is complete.
A police officer in Jamtara got two arrested youngsters to pretend making phishing calls — one in Hindi and the other in English — and recorded them on his mobile. “Sir, I, Om Sharma, calling from SBI branch, sir,” goes the fumbling boy in the video. Yet, the best of us get trapped.
The personal secretary to a Union cabinet minister filed anFIRat Parliament Street police station on November 3, 2015, saying he had been duped of Rs 35,000. AMumbai-based software engineer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, says the caller already knew his credit card details, even the due date of his bill. This convinced him to give away his CVV. He lost Rs 8,900. “I was sleepy and a bit disoriented,” says the victim.
With many of the IMEI numbers (the 15-digit unique identity) of phones used to make calls pointing to mobile towers in Jamtara, the district has over the last couple of years become a pilgrimage site for policemen from all over the country, all pursuing cyber crimes.
Additional Director General of Police (Operations) S N Pradhan, who once taught at the National Police Academy during which he was in touch with young police officers from other states, says, “Initially, it was a trickle. There would be one-two calls every week from police in other states. They all wanted to know where Jamtara was,” he says.
This was 2012 and by the next year, victims of fraud began contacting him directly. “By 2013-14, the trickle turned into a flow. Victims would track down the phones themselves and tell me the calls were from Jharkhand,” he says. All roads seemed to be leading to the district.
Once in Jamtara though, the trail often goes cold. By the time a police team arrives at Karmatar to arrest someone, at least a month would have passed after the crime. The SIM card used to make the call would have been discarded by then — it would have been bought in someone else’s name, anyway. For the police team that’s armed only with the IMEI number of the phone from which the call was made, it’s boots on the ground to locate the owner of the phone and then correlate him to the SIM cards used, the accounts to which money was moved and the items bought online.
To blame all of Jamtara for this would be unfair. Most calls originate from within two police station limits of the district: Karmatar and Narayanpur. While seven of the 13 cyber crime cases registered in Jamtara this year took place in Karmatar, four were in Narayanpur.
There are two files related to cyber crime at the Karmatar and Narayanpur police stations. In the first are records of arrests made by various visiting police teams. In the other, multiple times bigger than the first, are leads that went nowhere — requests for cooperation to arrest individuals and requests for more information about some. The file at the Karmatar police station has 76 such requests from 16 states, all except three were from this year. Narayanpur had 65 requests from 15 states, all except six were from 2015. Almost all the Hindi-speaking states are represented at Karmatar and Narayanpur. “Some boys who had travelled toTamil Nadufor work picked up some Tamil. We keep hearing rumours that they have begun scamming people there now,” says SI Kumar. At both the police stations, there is one case each from even the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
According to SI Nitish Kumar, almost all suspicious traffic originates from “six to seven mobile towers of Karmatar and two to three of Narayanpur”, especially villages that border the former. So far this year, police teams from 10 states have arrested 28 individuals from Jamtara in 22 cases, all of them residents of Karmatar police station limits. Even that fails to tell the entire story.

Karmatar would like to be called Vidyasagar after the scholar Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, who spent his last days in the town. The bazaar itself seems to want to hold on to a better memory — there are shops calling the place by both names.
These days, Vidyasagar also appears in posters all across the region. The posters advertise the ‘Vidyasagar Invitation T20 Cricket Tournament’, to be held in an empty field outside Mohanpur village. Those approaching Mohanpur are treated to a spectacle: an eight-gallery stadium, built entirely of bamboo, the unfinished stadium resembling a tiara of thrones. Pramod Mandal, assigned to construct the stadium for Rs 15 lakh, says he has stopped work because of “non-payment of dues”.
According to the posters, actorMadhuri Dixitwas to attend the opening ceremony on December 1, with Chief Minister Raghubar Das as chief guest. State Agriculture minister Randhir Singh, also the local legislator, is listed as the chairman of the organisers, ‘Tiranga Club, Murlidih’. Trouble is, police say the organisers, except the minister, are boys suspected to be involved in cyber crime. In fact, one of those listed as an organiser has already been arrested. Deepak Mandal, 26, a resident of Murlidih, was picked up by theChhattisgarhPolice on November 5.
SP Manoj Kumar Singh says the scam has led to Karmatar and Narayanpur being flush with money. It’s this money, he says, that is transforming villages, fuelling a construction boom. Almost every other house in Jhilua village near Karmatar is either new or is being constructed, even as roads continue to be nonexistent. TVS Apache is the preferred bike, the more prosperous have new Bajaj Pulsars, even SUVs.
Atop a steel almirah in the living quarters of Ravi Thakur, the Karmatar police station officer-in-charge, is a box withFlipkartlabels. “LED TV, 32-inch,” he says, without looking up. Karmatar police records show that during a raid at the house of one Wasim Ansari in Nawadih village on June 13 this year, they found unopened boxes of five phones, three fans, three mixers, one Samsonite suitcase and four LED TVs.
The money that is sent to e-wallets from the victims’ accounts is usually transferred to multiple platforms — youngsters recharge villagers’ DTH and mobile accounts in exchange for lesser amounts of money. An FIR by an individual named Varun Das at Narayanpur, filed after the UP Police came calling, claims that unknown individuals recharged his DTH account for Rs 4,000. Police officers say youngsters take legitimate bank accounts on hire by paying the original account holders a fixed monthly amount of money and transfer their ill-gotten wealth from e-wallets into them. Designated members of the team then travel to nearby towns to withdraw money from ATMs.
There are only two ATM machines in operation at Karmatar, both operated by the SBI. “We fill about Rs 5-10 lakh in one machine daily. The other is filled by our Jamtara branch, which deposits Rs 15-20 lakh every day. The first becomes cash-out in two hours; the second, in a day,” says Navin Chandra Jha, Service Manager at the Karmatar branch.
***
No one really knows how cyber crime came to Jamtara. “We suspect some youngsters who went to big cities to work as daily wage labourers came in contact with people who operate call centres that do phishing from more sophisticated settings,” says ADG Pradhan.
Cyber crime itself has evolved in Jamtara. Of the four cases registered in 2013, three were against youngsters who defrauded people by telling them that they had won a lottery and had to transfer a certain amount of money to claim the prize. In 2014, there was a phase when youngsters would advertise on television channels with the face of a known celebrity and challenge audiences to identify them. The ‘winner’ would be asked to deposit a processing fee to claim the prize.
ASP Triveni Singh of the UP Police says he is still investigating whether there is an organised nature to the operation in Jamtara, but local police insist the fraudsters operate in a decentralised manner. “All one needs to know is basic transaction procedures and an ability to talk smoothly,” says SP Manoj Kumar Singh.
Till earlier this year, Jamtara police operated as a post office of sorts, processing requests from all across the country and dispatching its own — the individuals accused of cyber crime — from its area. There had been allegations that some policemen were hand-in-glove with the accused, warning them ahead of raids. But that changed after SP Singh was appointed. “I have always been a field officer and knew nothing about such crimes. But I realised yeh lathi aur bandook ki ladaai nahi hai (that this needed an unconventional approach).” So he petitioned the police headquarters for a technical cell.
The technical cell is nothing much — two desktops manned by SI Nitish Kumar and an individual deputed by the CID in Ranchi — but it has got the ball rolling. The district police have even started conducting raids. “We wait for intelligence to come in that youngsters are sitting in a locality, making calls. We rush there, pick them up and confiscate the phones of those who run away,” says Ravi Thakur of the Karmatar station.
The accused land in jail but are out on bail in three-four months “because of lenient conditions in the IT Act”, says ADG Pradhan. “They have done a cost-benefit analysis and come to the conclusion that the money is worth the jail time,” he says.
With an OTP the only thing that stands between you and someone else’s money, the battle against phishing isn’t an easy one.“Start with selling SIM cards like passports, only after a police verification,” suggests a cyber crime expert in Ranchi who is not authorised to talk to the press. “The idea of minimal KYC for e-wallets should be defined properly and more authentication should be needed to open one,” says ASP Triveni Singh of the UP Police.
Till then, listen for the rustle of bamboo leaves and the whistle of a train at Vidyasagar station in the background when someone calls next time, claiming to be from the bank.
What’s phishing?
Phishing is defined as an “attempt to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details (and sometimes, indirectly, money), often for malicious reasons, by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication”. The term, which originated in the mid-1990, comes from fishing or angling for unsuspecting users. So any mail, text message or link that leads you to disclose a password, log-in details or banking card PINs should be treated as suspicious and avoided. Apps have also been known to create malafide forms that seek such sensitive information that can be misused. The best way to spot a phishing attempt is to look at the URL or mail ID it is originating from, as often these will not be what they are purporting to be.
E-FRAUD
93 crimes in Jharkhand in 2014, according to NCRB data. Plus a spike of 257 per cent in reported cases over the past year. Most of these cases can be traced to Jamtara district, and specifically to Karmatar town. Almost all suspicious traffic originates from 6-7 mobile towers of Karmatar, and 2-3 of Narayanpur town.
# In 2015 so far, police teams from 10 states have arrested 28 individuals from Jamtara in 22 cases, all of them residents of Karmatar police station limits.
# Jamtara police itself arrested 7 in 4 cases in 2013, 0 in 4 cases in 2014, and 13 in 12 cases in 2015.

***
Karmatar would like to be called Vidyasagar after the scholar Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, who spent his last days in the town. The bazaar itself seems to want to hold on to a better memory — there are shops calling the place by both names.
These days, Vidyasagar also appears in posters all across the region. The posters advertise the ‘Vidyasagar Invitation T20 Cricket Tournament’, to be held in an empty field outside Mohanpur village. Those approaching Mohanpur are treated to a spectacle: an eight-gallery stadium, built entirely of bamboo, the unfinished stadium resembling a tiara of thrones. Pramod Mandal, assigned to construct the stadium for Rs 15 lakh, says he has stopped work because of “non-payment of dues”.
According to the posters, actorMadhuri Dixitwas to attend the opening ceremony on December 1, with Chief Minister Raghubar Das as chief guest. State Agriculture minister Randhir Singh, also the local legislator, is listed as the chairman of the organisers, ‘Tiranga Club, Murlidih’. Trouble is, police say the organisers, except the minister, are boys suspected to be involved in cyber crime. In fact, one of those listed as an organiser has already been arrested. Deepak Mandal, 26, a resident of Murlidih, was picked up by theChhattisgarhPolice on November 5.
SP Manoj Kumar Singh says the scam has led to Karmatar and Narayanpur being flush with money. It’s this money, he says, that is transforming villages, fuelling a construction boom. Almost every other house in Jhilua village near Karmatar is either new or is being constructed, even as roads continue to be nonexistent. TVS Apache is the preferred bike, the more prosperous have new Bajaj Pulsars, even SUVs.
Atop a steel almirah in the living quarters of Ravi Thakur, the Karmatar police station officer-in-charge, is a box withFlipkartlabels. “LED TV, 32-inch,” he says, without looking up. Karmatar police records show that during a raid at the house of one Wasim Ansari in Nawadih village on June 13 this year, they found unopened boxes of five phones, three fans, three mixers, one Samsonite suitcase and four LED TVs.
The money that is sent to e-wallets from the victims’ accounts is usually transferred to multiple platforms — youngsters recharge villagers’ DTH and mobile accounts in exchange for lesser amounts of money. An FIR by an individual named Varun Das at Narayanpur, filed after the UP Police came calling, claims that unknown individuals recharged his DTH account for Rs 4,000. Police officers say youngsters take legitimate bank accounts on hire by paying the original account holders a fixed monthly amount of money and transfer their ill-gotten wealth from e-wallets into them. Designated members of the team then travel to nearby towns to withdraw money from ATMs.
There are only two ATM machines in operation at Karmatar, both operated by the SBI. “We fill about Rs 5-10 lakh in one machine daily. The other is filled by our Jamtara branch, which deposits Rs 15-20 lakh every day. The first becomes cash-out in two hours; the second, in a day,” says Navin Chandra Jha, Service Manager at the Karmatar branch.

No one really knows how cyber crime came to Jamtara. “We suspect some youngsters who went to big cities to work as daily wage labourers came in contact with people who operate call centres that do phishing from more sophisticated settings,” says ADG Pradhan.
Cyber crime itself has evolved in Jamtara. Of the four cases registered in 2013, three were against youngsters who defrauded people by telling them that they had won a lottery and had to transfer a certain amount of money to claim the prize. In 2014, there was a phase when youngsters would advertise on television channels with the face of a known celebrity and challenge audiences to identify them. The ‘winner’ would be asked to deposit a processing fee to claim the prize.
ASP Triveni Singh of the UP Police says he is still investigating whether there is an organised nature to the operation in Jamtara, but local police insist the fraudsters operate in a decentralised manner. “All one needs to know is basic transaction procedures and an ability to talk smoothly,” says SP Manoj Kumar Singh.
Till earlier this year, Jamtara police operated as a post office of sorts, processing requests from all across the country and dispatching its own — the individuals accused of cyber crime — from its area. There had been allegations that some policemen were hand-in-glove with the accused, warning them ahead of raids. But that changed after SP Singh was appointed. “I have always been a field officer and knew nothing about such crimes. But I realised yeh lathi aur bandook ki ladaai nahi hai (that this needed an unconventional approach).” So he petitioned the police headquarters for a technical cell.
The technical cell is nothing much — two desktops manned by SI Nitish Kumar and an individual deputed by the CID in Ranchi — but it has got the ball rolling. The district police have even started conducting raids. “We wait for intelligence to come in that youngsters are sitting in a locality, making calls. We rush there, pick them up and confiscate the phones of those who run away,” says Ravi Thakur of the Karmatar station.
The accused land in jail but are out on bail in three-four months “because of lenient conditions in the IT Act”, says ADG Pradhan. “They have done a cost-benefit analysis and come to the conclusion that the money is worth the jail time,” he says.
With an OTP the only thing that stands between you and someone else’s money, the battle against phishing isn’t an easy one.“Start with selling SIM cards like passports, only after a police verification,” suggests a cyber crime expert in Ranchi who is not authorised to talk to the press. “The idea of minimal KYC for e-wallets should be defined properly and more authentication should be needed to open one,” says ASP Triveni Singh of the UP Police.
Till then, listen for the rustle of bamboo leaves and the whistle of a train at Vidyasagar station in the background when someone calls next time, claiming to be from the bank.
What’s phishing?
Phishing is defined as an “attempt to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details (and sometimes, indirectly, money), often for malicious reasons, by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication”. The term, which originated in the mid-1990, comes from fishing or angling for unsuspecting users. So any mail, text message or link that leads you to disclose a password, log-in details or banking card PINs should be treated as suspicious and avoided. Apps have also been known to create malafide forms that seek such sensitive information that can be misused. The best way to spot a phishing attempt is to look at the URL or mail ID it is originating from, as often these will not be what they are purporting to be.
E-FRAUD
93 crimes in Jharkhand in 2014, according to NCRB data. Plus a spike of 257 per cent in reported cases over the past year. Most of these cases can be traced to Jamtara district, and specifically to Karmatar town. Almost all suspicious traffic originates from 6-7 mobile towers of Karmatar, and 2-3 of Narayanpur town.
# In 2015 so far, police teams from 10 states have arrested 28 individuals from Jamtara in 22 cases, all of them residents of Karmatar police station limits.
# Jamtara police itself arrested 7 in 4 cases in 2013, 0 in 4 cases in 2014, and 13 in 12 cases in 2015.

Nine people have been arrested in the Porsche accident case, including the 17-year-old driver whose blood sample was swapped with his mother's at Sassoon Hospital. A chargesheet has been filed and bail applications submitted, with evidence showing the driver was drunk. Previous arrests include the minor's parents and hospital staff for conspiring to swap the samples.

"Private sector companies are reluctant to approach the police even if they have lost large sums of money in cyber attacks fearing loss of goodwill and subsequent reduction of share prices. Mumbai Police Commissioner Ahmad Javed said this while releasing a cyber crime survey report for the year 2015.
Talking to the media, Javed said, “We are making an effort to approach the top bosses of corporates and encourage them to register complaints with us. On several occasions, the accused in most of these cases are same. So, making a formal complaint will only help them improve the overall security.”
An official said the two most common modus operandi used to target the corporate sector included the ‘man-in-the-email’ fraud in which primarily import-export companies were targetted. The gang sends a virus through an e-mail that helps them compromise the security of the server. The accused then start sending e-mails to other companies with which the import-export company is dealing, poses as the import-export company and asks them to deposit money in some other bank account, thereby defrauding the company.
The second modus operandi is to hack into the e-mail of the CEO of the company and then send an e-mail to a junior employee in the accounts department and ask him/her to transfer money to a particular bank account. The accused would also tell the junior employee to not inform anyone about the bank transfer. The junior would never dare approach the CEO of the company asking if he/she had indeed sent the e-mail.
KPMG, a risk and financial services provider carried out the survey after interviewing 250 senior executives of corporates.

"Organized crime takes a modern turn, far removed of an era of bootleg liquor or drug lords and illegal video poker machines labeled deceptively “for fun only”. There is no small time muscle man waiting in a car who rolls down the black tinted windows with a not so nice warning or hit man ordered by the Godfather to “take care of it”. These type of hoodlums still exist but there is a far more sinister criminal injustice that wreaks havoc in large volumes with potential to cause global implications.It is this type of powerful capabilities we shutter at the mere thought of “what if”.
Computer hackers became prominent in the 1980’s when the FBI investigates breach of security at the National CSS. When an employee of the National CSS revealed his password cracker, the company chastised him not for writing the software but by no telling them sooner of the security weakness and vulnerability.
Head honcho of Israeli, Gery Shalon, a 31-year-old from the Republic of Georgia in an organized cyber crime operation was involved in stock manipulation, money laundering, gambling and more that spread likecancerin a global scheme. According to US authorities there is nothing that even remotely comes close to corporate hacking than that of the global crime syndicate for the digital age. Federal prosecutors defined it as a mob operation involving more than 100 people in 12 countries with proceeds reaching into hundreds of millions of dollars. His hacking enterprise included running pump-and-dump stock schemes, credit card fraud, fake pharmaceuticals and running illegal online casinos.
He shook the very foundation of the corporate world with his “business model” for the 21st century while building a cyber empire of destruction. His group spread through internet arteries that are considered some of the largest cyber-attacks including reaching for the jugular vein in the biggest bank breach in history. Syphoning information from 83 million customer accounts from JP Morgan Chase Bank including hackers linked to the group breaching financial institutions and banks, pilfering information on 100 million customers.
“The conduct alleged in this case showcases the brave new world of hacking for profit,” U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan said in an announcement on two of the indictments that laid out parts of the scheme.
“It is no longer hacking merely for a quick payout,” Bharara said. “It is hacking as a business model.”
In the ongoing US investigation, the security fraud plot caused destruction to several online Casinos sites accepting US players. Shalon along with partner Ziv Orenstein were later linked in a connection to Affactive and Revenue Jet groups as rumors spread rapidly at gambling forums. The groups were connected to On Bling, Grand Parker, Loco Panda, Classy Coin, Ruby Royal, Grand Macao, Slots of Fortune and Jackpot Grand. In total the two men owned 13 online casinos.
Complaints from players came pouring in on gambling forums resulting in attaching warnings to casino reviews. On one Casino affiliate site an email reply from the finance department at Classy Casino in regards to non-payment complaint had this to say:
“Dear X,
You are a valued customer and we appreciate your business.
We would like to inform you that after reviewing your user activity which is based on your deposits during last 30 days, your withdrawal request was not approved at this time.
Please be advised that according to our policy which can be viewed in our Terms and Conditions (#12), your future activity in the casino will affect your withdrawal requests.
We appreciate your cooperation and look forward to seeing you back at our casino soon!
Please let us know if we can be of any further assistance.
Best regards,
Finance Department
Classy Coin Casino”
This was typical endless excuses to not pay players of legit withdrawals.
A rep from Revenue Jet had this to say in response to the overwhelming number of player complaints:
“I don’t know exactly who you are nor if you post on behalf of yourself or someone else, but you seem to be posting a lot of negative, potentially destructive posts intentionally and moderation seems to be needed here.”
“Every single post–be it in reply to a negative or positive resolutions–especially regarding The RJ casino group–seem to be negative. This behavior is unordinary and unacceptable, especially given that there’s now a team dedicated to help the members of the LCB forum.
“Some members here seem to appreciate our work and some don’t. Everyone are entitled to their opinions but it seems that you are spending too much time and energy scaring our players away for a reason not clear–so the forum moderators will look into this now.”
“You may be right and may be wrong, but I suggest you spend a minute thinking before you post as there are consequences to your actions, be it to you or those you post about.”
In July, 2015 all of the online Casinos closed down and exec director of the Gambling Portal Webmasters Association (GPWA) Michael Corfman received a notice Affactive was closing operations effective immediately. Corfman stated that all affiliate accounts “have been frozen including salaries and affiliate commissions.”
Shalon was also ruthless when it came to his rivals according to the government. He and his cronies allegedly hacked into other online gambling establishments to confiscate customer data and was responsible for the hack of two firms that supplied software to the casino platforms.
The government said that by 2012, Shalon became so destructive he orchestrated and engineered cyber-attacks to debilitate competitor gambling sites “in response to perceived misconduct” directed at his own casinos.
There were millions of dollars in revenue coming in from their world-wide organization and the group needed a resolution to processing and laundering cash according to prosecutors.
To resolve it Shalon and Orenstein along with others in their cyber crime spree took advantage of Shalon’s bitcoin-exchange company, Coin.mx. Transactions were processed and and their origins were hidden at the same time charging fees on every deal. Murgio, an ex-Florida State University student was arrested over the summer for operating Coin.mx.
The operation of money laundering was as complicated as other aspects of their entire operation. It involved using fake documents and aliases in at least 75 shell company accounts and to continually move gambling monies from account to account.
“The conduct alleged in this case also may signal next frontier in securities fraud, sophisticated hacking to steal material non-public information,” he said. The defendants discussed this “as the next stage of their sprawling criminal enterprise” Bharara said.

"Expressing concern over 70 per cent rise in the number of cyber crime cases last year, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday said that cyber security needs to be ensured for the success of the initiatives taken by government like Digital India, Make in India and Smart Cities.
Inaugurating a four-day information security conference “Ground Zero Summit 2015” in New Delhi, Singh said: “A person living in a remote area can now have access to information by which he can indulge in an act of terror, despite not being associated with any terror group.” He asked cyber security experts to be alert, especially towards ‘online radicalisation’.
Singh said that cyber security was a big challenge these days and ‘cyber barriers’ were needed to tackle it. “It is our duty that our critical infrastructure system should not collapse under any situation. This is also important that business continuity and disaster recovery plans are tested regularly and upgraded,” he said.
[related-post]
Singh said that the government has initiated efforts to set up “Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre” (I-4C) on the basis of the recommendations of the committee of Gulshan Rai, National Cyber Security Coordinator. This will help in monitoring and capacity building of cyber crimes, and will help law enforcement agencies in curtailing these crimes, he added.
NTRO chief wants a registry of IT engineers
At the conference, National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) chairman Alok Joshi mooted the idea of a National Cyber Registry “as a repository of IT professionals”.
The repository envisions identification of a talent pool and through sustained efforts could assist professionals to enhance respective domain knowledge.

"A school teacher in Mumbai’s central suburbs was recently informed by a student that he thought her Facebook account may have been hacked. He showed her messages sent to him via Facebook chat from her account. Shocked, she realised that someone had created a duplicate profile in her name, with her photograph and other details. Worse, she found several other students had received obscene messages from this duplicate account.
When she approached cyber police station, police found one of her students who she had reprimanded in class was behind the crime, something he probably thought was a prank to extract revenge. The minor was subsequently arrested by BKC cyber police station.

More and more youngsters keen on instant retribution and the perceived anonymity of the internet along with what police say is a ‘casual view of online misdemeanors’ are finding themselves in a run-in with the police. TheMumbaipolice encounters nearly three to five such cases everyday, where fake profiles are created and obscene content uploaded to tarnish someone’s reputation.
DCP Dhananjay Kulkarni said while they do not have statistics specifically for crime related to fake profiles, they have registered 242 offences related to social networking sites from January to October 15 this year, compared to 140 such cases in the period last year.
The biggest problem in such cases, according to officers, is that youngsters do not realise that what they are doing is a crime as defined by sections 66C (identity theft) and 66D (cheating by impersonation) of the Information Technology Act, 2000, in addition to certain sections of IPC.
“While it does happen in some cases that the victim finally realises that the person behind such profiles is known to them, depending upon the relation they share with the person, they may choose not to press charges. A lot of times if it is a youngster, the parents plead before the victim saying that it would destroy his/her life and the complainant understands. But such instances are now rare,” the officer said.
However, in some cases, like that of a Bhoiwada-based chartered accountant (CA), whose fake profile was created, anFIRhas already been registered. The CA approached cyber police when earlier this month, someone uploaded a post saying he was supplying ‘call girls’ after creating a fake profile in his name and tagged his relatives and friends in the post leading to a flurry of phone calls.
Similar was the case of a 22-year-old girl from a Vile Parle-based college who had stopped usingFacebookin 2011. Someone cropped her image from a group photograph that one of her friends had uploaded and used it to create a Facebook profile in her name and added her friends.
When ‘she’ started telling indecent things about her family, the friends approached her. “I realised that someone had created a fake profile in my name. But I have a clue who the person might be,” she toldThe Indian Express, while waiting to register an FIR at BKC cyber police station.
Cyber crime expert Vijay Mukhi says, “ There has to be a course on cyber security in schools in which it has to be drilled into the minds of youngsters.”
DCP Mohan Dahikar, who supervises the cyber police station, said that given this trend, people also have to be careful about what information they put up on the internet. “There are certain options in privacy settings that people need to use as well,” he said.

"TO get even with criminals who use the latest technologies and digital tools to commit crimes, the law enforcement authorities too are trying to make their officers tech-savvy to curb the number of crimes and crack the cases using the same tools.
Taking it to the next level, theMaharashtraPolice are now putting in special efforts to make the lowest rung cops — the constabulary — techno-savvy. The Directorate of Police Training has instructed all ten police training centres (PTCs) in the state to make digital interventions in the year-long training modules of the newly inducted constables. About 8,800 constables are presently under training in 10 PTCs in the state where the digitisation is going to be implemented.
[related-post]
The glitch in the story, however, is that the required gadgets — one tablet PC per trainee is to be bought by the trainee with his or her own money. The training centre, on its part, will spend funds to set up the infrastructure to make the campuses Wi-Fi enabled.
The project has been rolled out at the Khandala PTC — about 50 kms fromPunecity — where 800 women police constables are currently under training.The project, officials say, will slowly be extended to remaining nine other PTCs. Of the ten PTCs in the state, three exclusively cater to female cops.According to sources in the state police department, the idea for this “project” came from Additional Director General of Police Dr K Venkatesham. The aim, they say, is to make the police constables as technologically competitive as the officers.
At Khandala PTC which trains 800 female cops every year, the “digital intervention” has created quite a buzz. While there’s enthusiasm among a big chunk of trainees to learn about the crime investigation, laws and handling of sensitive situations and working knowledge of English language through the gadgets, there are others who have apprehensions about spending money to buy a tablet PC when they can use their mobile handhelds for the same purpose.
“I already own a Samung Galaxy phone. It’s more efficient than a tablet. Why should buy the tap,” a 22-year-old trainee hailing from Satara said.
The administration, on the the other hand, said that they will not force anyone to buy the tablet “provided they own a smart phone which will serve the purpose.”“Our aim is to introduce newly inducted constables to ultra modern techniques using the digital training methods. No one would disagree that the conventional training methods have to be replaced with the latest ones. Until now – while training lower run cops – our emphasis was more on field training than classroom training. Now with changing times when most of the crimes are either cyber crimes or have cyber angle, there’s need to make our constabulary cyber friendly. We are also trying to make the training module paperless as all textbooks, laws will be provided to students in soft copies,” said Sadashiv Nikam, Deputy Superintendent of Police, working with Khandala PTC.
The administration has signed contracts with half a dozen tablet PC providers including iBall, Micromax,SamsungandDellwhich will supply the tablets — price of which will range between Rs 3,500 and 7,500. The amount can be paid in three to six installments.
“It’s the trainee who have to choose the device as per his needs and preference. We are only facilitators. Also, those who have good smartphones and don’t want to buy the tabs are free to do so. Our concern is that none should lag behind,” said Nikam adding, “four-five thousand rupees isn’t much for trainees who are paid Rs 17-18 thousand a month.”
“It remains to be seen if this exercise paves way for making the police force tech friendly or provides fodder for allegations of corruption as is being feared by some in the force,” officials said.

"IMAGINE you are a newlywed and on your honeymoon, or a single girl traveller who fears that the hotel room might have a hidden camera. What would one do in such a situation? What if, you still have your ATM card on you, yet a transaction has taken place with it elsewhere. Or what happens when someone creates your fake Facebook profile and hacks your email? Don’t worry, city’s renowned cyber crime experts Arun Soni and Sahil Baghla have answers to all such questions in their book Digital Cop, which was released on Tuesday.
“There are parents who are worried about their children surfing too much Internet, tense whether their children will be back in time. We live in a digitally active world, surrounded by technology, yet we are the most clueless and vulnerable when it comes to securing and protecting ourselves from its vicious hackers. With Digital Cop, we are providing that security guard,” say Soni and Baghla.
A one-of-a-kind book, it’s a layman’s guide to cyber security, and gives valuable tips to secure your virtual life and be a digital vigilante. From keeping a check on your child’s Internet activity, deleting your fakeFacebookprofile, searching for hidden spy cams, sending self-destruct secret emails, protecting one from debit/credit card hacking, to tracing lost smartphone/laptop, keeping tabs on employees in one’s absence, downloading best smartphone security apps for women, searching for genuine websites to earn money by working from home, Digital Cop is a one-stop page-turner for the tech-savvy generation.
[related-post]
Not only this, the authors, who invested more than two years in putting this book together, also give tips on what to do once a cyber crime takes place. “How to report, where to report and what to do next is something people are unaware of,” says Soni.
The book also provides a variety of practical applications and online safeguards to help the public extract the best out of technology and not get beaten down by it. Real-life situations, screenshots and steps mentioned and download links along with each article are highlight of this book.
“There are two kinds of people in the digitally active world — ones who know they have been hacked, and ones who don’t know they have been hacked and continue using the technology. It’s the latter that is in need of immediate assistance before colossal damage is done,” says award-winning author Soni, who comes with a 23-year experience in the field of computer education and celebrates this book as his hundredth.
A certified ethical hacker like Baghla, Soni points out the sharp increase in cyber crime and how one needs simplified books like these to tackle the same.
“Most of the times, books have heavy jargon which a layman is unable to follow. Also, technology keeps changing, so our aim was to focus on those aspects that are part of our daily lives, like banking, Facebook, WhatsApp, travel, and provide security measures for the same,” adds Baghla, who also runs an IT company EH1 Infotech and is the president of India’s First Anti-Hacking Welfare Society.
The book is available on most of the online portals. For more, log on tohttp://www.digitalcopbook.com.

"A look at cyber crime data reveals that neighbours, friends, relatives, disgruntled employees, business competitors, and ‘sexual freaks’ formed the majority of people booked or arrested for cyber crime in 2014 in Maharashtra, as per National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). The others were from the field of religion and politics, and those with psychological disorders. The trend was similar across India.
ACP Nandkishore More, who headed theMumbaicyber wing in 2014, said the motive varied. While some were emotional “spur of the moment” responses aimed at causing temporary pain, others were crimes to make money or cause economic loss to rivals.
[related-post]
Additional DG Himanshu Roy, Joint Commissioner (Crime), who oversaw the cyber wing of Mumbai Police last year too, said, “Because of the anonymity internet affords, it becomes an attractive option for someone to get back at another person. This explains why neighbours, friends and relatives top the list of booked.”
Cyber expert Vijay Mukhi said, “In fact, cases where family and friends are involved would be higher. A lot of times after the complainant realizes that the person behind the crime is a known person, a compromise is reached and the complaint is withdrawn.”
A total of 100 persons booked/arrested were known to victims as neighbours, friends or relatives in the 942 cases.
Mukhi cited an incident a few years back of a woman who started receiving obscene calls in the middle of the night. She found that someone had put up a post on a social media platform along with her phone number stating that since her husband left at night, she was alone and invited people to call. She approached police, and on investigation, it turned out that it was her neighbour who had put up the advertisement following a fight over a parking spot weeks back.
More said that in most cases, it was a spur of the moment reaction. This, he added, was also why several students featured so prominently in the list. Mukhi said that because of cyber bullying, a fight between them would lead to someone putting up a nasty post against the other on a networking site. A total of 91 students had been booked for cyber crime last year acrossMaharashtra.
An officer said that while computer geeks were normally involved in hacking and using their expertise to commit financial frauds, business competitors and disgruntled employees – a category that had 28 FIRs against them — were involved in data theft. Explaining data theft, the officer said there have been cases wherein an employee made away with database of customers of a company and sold it to another company, or used it to get a job. More added that religious people — a catergory with 55 cases — and political people (15 cases) were normally those booked for using the internet to polarize people on religious or political grounds.

Nine people have been arrested in the Porsche accident case, including the 17-year-old driver whose blood sample was swapped with his mother's at Sassoon Hospital. A chargesheet has been filed and bail applications submitted, with evidence showing the driver was drunk. Previous arrests include the minor's parents and hospital staff for conspiring to swap the samples.

"“On June 2, Mohsin Shaikh, an IT professional, was beaten to death in Pune allegedly by members of a right wing organisation over some photographs denigrating Maratha warrior king Shivaji and Shiv Sena founder late Bal Thackeray.”
“On June 9, alleged objectionable images of Dalit leader B R Ambedkar that surfaced on a social networking website sparked stray incidents of arson inPune, Aurangabad and Solapur.”
[related-post]
“On June 21, seven policemen were injured when a mob went on a stone-pelting spree in Deopur area of Dhule district, 600km fromMumbai, after rumours spread that objectionable content about a minority community had been posted onFacebook.”
The above cases are not mere aberrations, rather some of the very few instances that have been thrown at our faces, as per the latest data released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) for 2014.Maharashtratops the list of states that ‘incited hate crimes against communities’ using the internet.
In fact, the distant second to Maharashtra’s 120 cases in the past year isUttar Pradeshwith 21 cases. Policemen, however, pointed out that this trend was largely due to the fact that they mounted up online patrolling following several incidents like the riot at Dhule over a Facebook post, which led to more FIRs being registered.
Incidentally, Maharashtra has been the state that registered most cyber crime cases for both 2013 and 2014 across India.
DGP (Maharashtra) Sanjeev Dayal said, “In light of some instances such as Dhule and Pune, we had scaled our efforts to ensure that morphed images were not shared.”
An officer who was heading the cyber crime wing in 2014 also said that while there were two or three major instances in one place like Dhule, they had had to register complaints at several places where people had shared the same image leading to multiple FIRs.
Another officer claimed the fact that the state elections took place in 2014 could also be a factor as months prior to the elections, anti-social elements use various networking platforms to polarise voters. “Given the nature of the internet, it takes no time to make them viral,” the officer added.
Mumbai police spokesperson DCP Dhananjay Kulkarni attributed the high numbers to the constant monitoring activities of the social media cell of the Mumbai police set up in 2013 to keep a track on content on social media in order to curb sharing of derogatory photographs that could be offensive to a particular community. “As a result of the constant monitoring we do end up registering severalFIR’s. It would be wrong to conclude that Maharashtra has more such crimes, it just that more such cases are reported because of our efforts.”
Cyber expert Vijay Mukhi however opined that even in rural areas most people use social media. And that increases the possibility of misuse.

Along with financial frauds involving international racketeers, the menace of cyber crime is growing dangerously among family, friends and community, causing hatred, hurting personal as well as religious sentiments.
Police and cyber lawyers are receiving a large number of such complaints from the victims. Police say that at least 40 per cent of the family disputes these days have something or else to do with the cellphone or social media communication.
Cyber law experts believe cases of cyber crime against women is on the rise, particularly after the Supreme Court scrapped sections 66 (A) of the Information Technology Act, which allowed arrest of persons posting offensive content on social media.
Advocate Prashant Mali, a cyber law expert, says, “After the SC ruling on section 66 (A) of IT Act, we have observed a rise on cyber crimes against women. Cyber crimes affecting family and marriages are a serious concern. There are cases like husband hacking email address of wife and posting objectionable content to defame her due to some domestic dispute.”
Cyber crime and intellectual property rights lawyer,VaishaliBhagwat, said, “We come across several legal cases related to the misuse of social media and phone messenger services by users from educational institutes and employees of companies.”
“We have a case from an institute in Pune where a WhatsApp group of some students was formed. The original administrator of group had left due to some reason. There was no activity on that group. But one day, someone posted an objectionable message on the group… It shows that when it comes to the use of social media, the colleges and commercial establishments do not have any policies. There should set of rules as to who can form such groups, who can be the administrator and whether there will be any restrictions on what kind of content will be shared,” Bhagwat says.
According to Bhagwat, since section 66A of the IT Act has been scrapped, there is need of another equivalent law section which would address the issue of defamation of personal nature.
Advocate Supriya Kothari, who specialises in family law and runs a helpline for women, says, “We have come across several cases in which the private moments are shot on cellphones and sent to friends or in in cases spread on the Internet to take revenge or to malign the image of the other person. In many cases, these things even happen between married couples. A joke, a cartoon, a photo can have obscene, objectionable content and may hurt sentiments of individuals or groups and at times communities.”
Deputy Commissioner of Police (Cyber crime) D K Sakore says, “We receive many such complaints at cyber cell related to disputes between family and friends. In serious cases, offences are registered. In minor cases, attempts are made for compromise between two parties.”
Police sources say they are finding it difficult to control use of social media in spreading hate messages, particularly those hurting communal sentiments. Police are unable to trace the prime suspects in majority of such cases. Even after arrests, the convictions are low in number.
“Most of the police officers and their tools are not technically up to the mark. Hence, the collection of evidence becomes extremely difficult. Inability of prosecutions to come up with credible and legally valid electronic evidence hampers the case. Also, most of the time, electronic evidence is not captured in the right manner nor it is retained and preserved in the manner required by the Indian Evidence Act,” says advocate Mali.
Precautions
Filming or photography of any private moment, even by those who are trusted, should be avoided. It is also important women and girls come forward and register complaints in these cases.

"1. Cyber fraudsters withdrew over $45,000 (Rs 28.45 lakh) from Megha Sonar’s bank account without her consent. Sonar is based in Australia and has her account in Bank of Maharashtra (BoM) in Pune. Her money was transferred to a bank account in Hong Kong. BoM filed a police complaint in April 2015. No arrests have been made yet.
2. Cyber fraudsters lured a businessman, Akash Bajaj (23) of Pimpri, by promising him huge financial returns on investment in herbal seeds trade. After he paid them Rs 10.74 lakh in cash and through online transactions, they vanished. Bajaj filed a police complaint in June 2015. No arrests have been made so far.
3. Cyber criminals posing as bank and telecom company officials contacted Hamida Taj (61) of Kondhwa Khurd over phone. They told Hamida she had won a prize of Rs 25 lakh and a car. They managed to get confidential details of her bank account. They then withdrew Rs 10,79,550 from it through online transactions. She filed a police complaint in April 2015. In this case too, there have been no arrests.

Even as incidents of cyber crime are on the rise in the city,Punepolice do not seem to be maintaining proper records of such cases.
Applications filed byThe Indian Expressunder the Right to Information (RTI) Act have revealed that neither the cyber crime cell, that started on May 29, 2005, nor any other branch of the Pune police commissionerate has compiled data on cyber crime cases registered in its jurisdiction. This at a time when an average of one complaint per day is received at the cyber cell, apart from others at police stations.The records of such cases are essential for a better understanding, investigation and prevention of cyber crimes
The newspaper filed two RTI applications seeking details of all offences registered under sections of the Information Technology (IT) Act at the cyber crime cell and all police stations under the Pune police commissionerate between January 2005 and May 2015.
In reply to both RTI applications, assistant commissioner of police (crime) Rajendra Joshi, the public information officer (PIO), said that such data is not compiled by the Pune police commissionerate. It added that police stations are the source for this information. So a fresh application was filed at the office of divisional ACPs, who are the PIOs for police stations.
Deputy Commissioner of Police (cyber cell) D K Sakore said, “The process of compiling details of cyber crimes in our jurisdiction is on. We will study the cases and do a proper analysis for understanding new trends, modus operandi and other important aspects.”
A cyber security expert closely working with the police said, “Collective analysis of crimes helps in understanding important aspects like which kind of people are being targeted, the timings and places of crime, the mistakes committed by victims due to which they fell prey to fraudsters, new modus operandi. It helps in investigation and also in prevention of cyber crimes.”
The state CID compiles data on cyber crimes along with all kinds of offences as a part of its annual “Crime inMaharashtra” record. But this data is not recent. Currently, the CID has data on cyber crimes till 2013. According to the figures, Pune leads in the list of cyber crimes.
In 2013, as many as 97 cases under IT act were registered with Pune city police, in which 38 persons were arrested. Yavatmal ranked second with 61 cases and Thane city third with 52 offences. Even in 2012, Pune was leading with 108 cases under IT act, Thane second with 89 cases.Mumbaiwas third with 33 offences.
Financial frauds, eve teasing, revenge and hatred form a major part of cyber crimes in Pune. Foreign nationals are involved particularly in online frauds. But only one foreign national was arrested in cyber crime in 2013 and seven in 2012.

"Mumbai Police is training staff at every police station on the basics of cyber crime so that they can register an FIR under relevant laws. This will eliminate the need for cyber crime victims to travel all the way to the cyber police station in the Bandra-Kurla Complex.
Officials said the initiative will also lead to faster registering of FIRs and thus facilitate speedy investigation.
“Currently, there is only one cyber police station in BKC, where people from across the city register FIRs on cyber crime. We are working on a mechanism so that they need not go to BKC for this. At least one officer in each police station will be trained on the basics of cyber crime so that he can register anFIRas soon as it is reported at the police station. The case can later be transferred to the cyber police station or Cyber Crime Investigation Cell (CCIC) of the Crime Branch,” said Joint Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Deven Bharti.
[related-post]
Officers said that many police personnel hesitate to register a cyber crime. They send the complainants to the cyber police station or CCIC without understanding the nature of the case. “This is because of poor understanding of the Information Technology Act and other laws on cyber crime like phishing, hacking, credit card fraud and threatening emails, coupled with lack of knowledge of basic steps to be taken to ensure a strong case. The personnel should be able to at least record statements from complainants and register an FIR,” said a police officer.
Bharti said that after the training is complete, simple cases may also be investigated by the police station personnel themselves, which will reduce the workload of the cyber police station and CCIC. “Investigating officers from the police stations can always seek assistance from the cyber police station or CCIC if the need arises,” he said.
The Crime Branch is also taking other initiatives to tackle the growing menace of cyber crime which, along with economic offences, is said to be the crime of the future. Recently, around 50 officers of the Crime Branch enrolled for a training programme with aPune-based cyber training institute to brush up their knowledge of cyber crime, its laws and investigation techniques.

"Despite incessant warnings from his own department about the dangers of giving out bank account details to strangers Karnataka’s police chief himself has fallen prey to a telephonic phishing scam with Rs 10,000 being siphoned out from his account by a person who claimed to be calling to verify his bank account details. The Karnataka DG and IGP Om Prakash fell prey to the fraud two months ago and the state’s cyber police wing have arrested two persons from Delhi in connection with the case this week.
[related-post]
The accused have been identified as Deepan Kumar and Ashraf Ali. The cyber wing of the police which is attached to the Criminal Investigation Department had registered a case of fraud on the basis of a complaint lodged by DGP Om Prakash. According to police one of the accused persons called DGP Om Prakash on his phone and introduced himself as a member of the helpdesk of ICICI Bank’s credit card division. The caller told the police chief that he needed details of the card including the date of birth, validity and PIN as part of an online renewal process of the card.
Within minutes of being provided the details the accused used the credit card to withdraw Rs 10,000 and the DGP realized he had been cheated when he received an SMS message about the transaction. A police team tracked down the culprits on the basis of the number they had used to contact the DGP. The team managed to arrest Deepan Kumar on May 20 in Delhi and based on information provided by Kumar the other accused person Ali was arrested this week.
Police said that the accused persons were facing similar charges of fraud in Gujarat andTamil Nadu. TheKarnatakaDGP fell prey to the fraudsters despite the cyber wing of the CID police frequently issuing warnings to the public about phishing scams in the light of several such complaints being registered. A retired judge had also fallen prey to similar scammers recently. The CID has re-issued its warning against divulging details of bank accounts to unknown callers.

"Sociology students of Mumbai University and its affiliated colleges will soon have to study the dimensions of social networking sites and cyber crime in society. The department of sociology of Mumbai University will include two chapters on social networking and cyber crime in the syllabus from the coming academic year which begins from June.
The chapters will be included in the sociology syllabus for the First Year Bachelors of Arts (FYBA). According to department authorities, the course will not only provide students an introduction to the study of social networks and cyber crime but will also teach them the political and social effects on the society and individuals.
“We will focus on understanding the causes and consequences of the patterns of relationships between individuals. Everyone, be it college students, teachers, senior citizens or even school kids, knows how to use social networking sites… However, through the detailed chapters, we want to teach students the political dimensions of the two topics,” said Prahlad Jogdand, Chairman of the Board of Studies of Sociology and Dean, Faculty of Arts, MU.
[related-post]
“Social networking sites play a vital role in society today. It is news all the while and hence it is necessary as a student of sociology to study it in detail. PMNarendra Modiand theBJPrelied a great deal on social networking sites for campaigning. The party managed to reach out to the masses on a large scale through the social network,” Jogdand added.
The chapters will include topics such as increasing usage of social networking sites and trends, its effect on the society, use of social media by political parties during elections, economic dimensions of social networking sites, cyber crime, case studies under cyber crime, acts and laws of cyber crime etc.
“Besides, too much use of social networking sites has increased the rate of cyber crimes across the world. Many of us do not even know that certain acts of ours on social media may land us in trouble under cyber crime rules. All these factors make these topics very relevant for sociology students,” said Jogdand.
He added, “We are currently working on preparing reference materials…there are hardly any books on this topic in Marathi. Hence, we will also prepare reference material in Marathi for students whose medium of instruction is Marathi.”

"India has sought assistance from Japan on the latest technologies and expertise to tackle cyber criminals in Internet espionage, cyber terrorism and stealing personal as well as critical data.
Last week, officials from the Ministry of Telecom and the Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeitY) met with a visiting top Japanese trade delegation led by Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Yoichi Miyazawa.
Both sides discussed how the two countries can join hands to check cyber crime, an official source said.
The major area of focus was technologies that can help in securing the flow of information on the Internet as well as protect critical government data on cloud. India has also asked Japan to help it with technologies that can check hackers and network intrusions, the source added.
Besides the relevant technology, discussions also covered India’s cyber security laws.
“In view of the country’s rising status, the Japanese delegation felt that India should have the relevant law enforcement infrastructure, including a legal framework, to tackle cyber crime so as to assure the global business community that their investments are safe,” another government official said.
The issue assumes importance, given that Japan has evinced strong interest in investing in India in many sectors, including information and communications technology (ICT).
Besides, the delegation has pledged to invest around USD 3 billion in India in the immediate future in various sectors, especially IT and telecom.
Last week, Japan signed a 5-point action agenda with India to increase bilateral trade and investment between the two nations, including working on development and co-operation in the IT sector, enhancing cooperation in strategic sectors and Asia-Pacific economic integration.

"Another case of cyber crime in March has come to light and the victim is again a woman, like the previous case that reportedly took place the same month. According to the woman who has filed a complaint with police, online transfer of money was carried out without her knowledge. Police have booked a suspect, who is believed to have called up the woman to get her to divulge information pertaining to the bank account to later transfer money without her consent.
The victim of the latest cyber crime is 33-year-old Sayara Pathan of Pimple Nilakh who has registered a complaint with Sangvi police. Police, acting on her complaint has booked Amankumar Gupta (a fictitious name suspected to have been used by the fraudster to evade detection.) The cops have invoked section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code and sections of the Information Technology (IT) Act in the case. Assistant police inspector S V Gade is investigating the case.
[related-post]
Police said Sayara got a call from the man on her cell phone last month. He claimed to be a bank officer and asked details of ATM cards she had for her accounts with the State Bank of India and the Bank ofMaharashtra.
She shared the information with him and he allegedly misused it to withdraw Rs 34,890 from her bank account without her consent through illegal online transactions. Police said the crime took place on March 16-17. Police suspect Amankumar Gupta is not the real name of the fraudster.
Earlier, in a similar case, another woman, Kalpana Mahajan (53), of Akurdi was cheated of Rs 1.1 lakh by unidentified online fraudsters. She lodged a complaint at Nigdi police station.
Police said a man claiming to be a bank officer called Mahajan on her cell phone on March 8, 2015. He asked Mahajan to part with personal information and details of her bank account. Using these details he allegedly transferred Rs 1.10 lakh from Mahajan’s account without her consent through illegal online transaction. Police said people should be aware of such fraudulent phone calls and avoid sharing personal details with anybody.
Police said anybody getting such calls should cross-check with bank officials whether the calls are authentic, before sharing personal information.

"Hackers, most likely from China, have been spying on governments and businesses in Southeast Asia and India uninterrupted for a decade, researchers at internet security company FireEye Inc said.
In a report released on Monday, FireEye said the cyber espionage operations dated back to at least 2005 and “focused on targets – government and commercial – who hold key political, economic and military information about the region.”
“Such a sustained, planned development effort coupled with the (hacking) group’s regional targets and mission, lead us to believe that this activity is state-sponsored – most likely the Chinese government,” the report’s authors said.
Bryce Boland, Chief Technology Officer for Asia Pacific at FireEye and co-author of the report, said the attack was still ongoing, noting that the servers the attackers used were still operational, and that FireEye continued to see attacks against its customers, who number among the targets.
Reuters couldn’t independently confirm any of the assertions made in the report.
China has always denied accusations that it uses the Internet to spy on governments, organisations and companies. Neither the Foreign Ministry nor the Cyberspace Administration of China, the Internet regulator, immediately responded to written requests for comment on the FireEye report on Monday.
China has been accused before of targeting countries in South and Southeast Asia. In 2011, researchers from McAfee reported a campaign dubbed Shady Rat which attacked Asian governments and institutions, among other targets.
Efforts by the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to build cyber defences have been sporadic. While ASEAN has long acknowledged its importance, “very little has come of this discourse,” said Miguel Gomez, a researcher at De La Salle University in the Philippines.
The problem is not new: Singapore has reported sophisticated cyber-espionage attacks on civil servants in several ministries dating back to 2004.

The campaign described by FireEye differs from other such operations mostly in its scale and longevity, Boland said.
He said the group appeared to include at least two software developers. The report did not offer other indications of the possible size of the group or where it’s based.
The group remained undetected for so long it was able to re-use methods and malware dating back to 2005, and developed its own system to manage and prioritize attacks, even organising shifts to cope with the workload and different languages of its targets, Boland told Reuters.
The attackers focused not only on governments, but on ASEAN itself, as well as corporations and journalists interested in China. Other targets included Indian or Southeast Asian-based companies in sectors such as construction, energy, transport, telecommunications and aviation, FireEye says.
Mostly they sought to gain access by sending so-called phishing emails to targets purported to come from colleagues or trusted sources, and containing documents relevant to their interests.
Boland said it wasn’t possible to gauge the damage done as it had taken place over such a long period, but he said the impact could be “massive”.
“Without being able to detect it, there’s no way these agencies can work out what the impacts are. They don’t know what has been stolen.”

Nine people have been arrested in the Porsche accident case, including the 17-year-old driver whose blood sample was swapped with his mother's at Sassoon Hospital. A chargesheet has been filed and bail applications submitted, with evidence showing the driver was drunk.

"The Cyber Crime Investigation Cell of the Thane Police detected a mere 10 per cent of all cases registered in 2014, with no breakthroughs in the FIRs registered during the last three months.Data obtained from the Thane Police shows that its cyber cell detected 41 of the 85 cases registered under the Information Technology Act in 2012, making 55 arrests in the process.
The following year, 2013, the cell registered 58 cases, detected 17 and arrested 24 persons.
In 2014, however, the detection rate took a nosedive, with 207 cases registered and 23 detected.
[related-post]
A total of 27 arrests were made, of which, 18 were aged between 19 and 30 years, the police said. April 2014 was the cyber cell’s best month, with 13 cases registered, six detected and four arrests made.
Inspector Sanju John, who heads the cyber cell, said that there were a number of factors to explain the detection rate. “A major hurdle is that the servers of e-mail service providers like Gmail are not located in India. When we write seeking details of suspect account-holders, we do not receive any response,” he said.
John added that in many cases, arrests were not possible even after the Internet Protocol addresses of the perpetrators of the crimes had been identified.
“The accused in many crimes live in countries with which India does not either have friendly ties or an extradition treaty. Perpetrators of cyber crimes have also been using sophisticated software to mask their IP addresses. This makes it difficult to find the exact location of the accused,” John added.
Banking fraud comprises a majority of cases registered by the Thane cyber cell in 2014. “Last year, we received many complaints of money being siphoned off from bank accounts by callers posing to be representatives of banks. They dupe their victims into parting with their details of debit or credit cards. Over the years, there has been a huge increase in these cases,” he said.
“450 calls were made to residents of Thane in 2014 to commit banking fraud. All of these were made using SIM cards registered in Bihar and Jharkhand,” John said.

"The Internet has given us many glorious things: streaming movies, multiplayer games, real-time information and videos of cats playing the piano. It has also offered up some less edifying creations: web-borne viruses, cyber crime and Charles C Johnson.
His name came out of nowhere and now seems to be everywhere. When the consumer Internet first unfolded, there was much talk about millions of new voices blooming. Johnson is one of those flowers. His tactics may have as much in common with ultimate fighting as journalism, but that doesn’t mean he is not part of the conversation.
Johnson, a 26-year-old blogger based in California, has worked his way to the centre of the controversy over a Rolling Stone article about rape accusations made by a student at the University of Virginia. His instinct that the report was deeply flawed was correct, but he proceeded to threaten on Twitter to expose the student and then later named her. And he serially printed her photo while going after her in personal and public ways.
In the frenzy to discredit her, he published aFacebookphoto of someone he said was the same woman at a rally protesting an earlier rape. Oops. Different person. He did correct himself, but the damage, now to two different women, was done.
Before that, his targets were two reporters for The New York Times who, he said, revealed the address of the police officer in the Ferguson, Missouri, shooting. (They didn’t. They published the name of a street he once lived on, which had already been published in The Washington Post.) Before that, he attacked the victim of the shooting, Michael Brown.
Before that, he attacked Senator Cory Booker, saying the lawmaker did not live in Newark, New Jersey, when he was the city’s mayor; BuzzFeed wrote that Johnson not only was wrong, but had worked for a political action committee that opposed Booker.
He also wrote a series of Twitter messages that suggested PresidentBarack Obamawas gay. He offered money for photos of Senator Thad Cochran’s wife in her nursing home bed. Before that, well, it doesn’t really matter; you get the pattern.
He is not without some talent — he effectively ended the career of the rising foreign policy analyst Elizabeth O’Bagy after exposing her conflicts of interest and fudged academic credentials. In general, he has a knack for staking an outrageous, attacking position on a prominent news event, then pounding away until he is noticed. It is one way to go, one that says everything about the underreported news era we are living through.
In a phone call, he made it clear that he sees himself as part of the vanguard of Internet news, although he did add that some of what he is up to is a response to a lifetime of slights. “I’m basically one of those kids who was bullied all his life,” he said.
After watching him set off a series of small mushroom clouds, it struck me that he might be the ultimate expression of a certain kind of citizen journalism — one far more toxic than we’re accustomed to seeing.
He can now push the button on almost anything that has heat, a scent of scandal or the ability to activate his base of angry, conspiratorial readers, who believe the republic is being overwhelmed by criminals, feminists and the politicians who enable them. And then the rest of the journalistic establishment — including me — points a crooked finger at the naughty young man who is using his mouse to sow mayhem.
Although he was temporarily suspended from Twitter for publishing the personal information of others, he’s back on that site preaching to anyone who will listen. I’d ignore him if I thought he would go away, but I get the feeling he won’t.
In conversation, Johnson is prone to narcissism, not uncommon in media types, but he has his own special brand of it. He sees himself as a major character in a great unfolding epoch, dwelling on his school-age accomplishments, journalism awards, and vaguely suggesting that he has strong ties to many levels of law enforcement. Like what, I asked?
“Have you ever read the book or heard of the book Encyclopedia Brown?” he asked, referring to a series about a boy detective. “That’s the capacity in which I help them.”
My worry is that people who have made it this far in the column will click over to GotNews to see what all the fuss is about.
What they will find is a clear look into the molten core of certain mindset, a place where conspiracies are legion, victims are portrayed as perpetrators and so-called news is a fig leaf on a far darker art.

"In light of the ever widening scope of cyber crimes, a group of 45 policemen with the Mumbai Police Crime Branch is currently undergoing a comprehensive course on cyber crime investigation.
According to Crime Branch sources, the decision was taken after it was observed that while the Crime Branch gets diverse cases of cyber crime, the investigating officers need to be up-to-date with the latest cyber crime methods as well as techniques to investigate them.
Officials said it was recently noticed that cyber crimes had gone far beyond someone posting offensive or morphed content on social networking websites, and that investigation skills also need to be upgraded accordingly.
Hence, senior Crime Branch officers got in touch with the Asian School of Cyber Law inPune, which offers several comprehensive courses on cyber crime and investigation.
“After discussing our needs and factors like the time that our personnel have to spend on the field, ASCL came up with a customised course for us, which began around three weeks ago. It is basically a correspondence course, where most of the study material is sent online, with a classroom session in the Bandra Kurla Complex once a week. The course deals with cyber crimes, cyber law and cyber forensics,” said Additional Commissioner of Police (Crime) K M M Prasanna.
The batch of policemen undergoing the course includes Prasanna, two Deputy Commissioners of Police with the Crime Branch, the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Cyber Crime, and personnel from the Cyber Crime Investigation Cell, the Cyber Police Station in BKC and various other units of the Crime Branch.
Recalling one of the sessions, DCP (Detection) Dhananjay Kulkarni said, “One of the cyber crimes discussed at the last session was an amazingly simple method to acquire a target’s location. An email is sent out by a miscreant to the target, which claims that a girl wants to get in touch with him on a little known social networking portal, and the email has a link, purportedly for the portal. The moment the target clicks on the link, the geographical coordinates of the target are sent to the miscreant, while the target sees a web page that says that the page is unavailable or some such error.”
Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) Sadanand Date added, “Based on the feedback after the course gets over, we might explore the possibility of making this a regular exercise.”
The Crime Branch is also considering sending a proposal to the government, and asking that at least five officers from every police station be made to undergo the course so that a major bulk of theMumbaiPolice strength is proficient in cyber crime investigation, said officials.

"Eight days after a massive cyber attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment, the Hollywood studio was still struggling to restore some systems on Tuesday evening as investigators combed for evidence to identify the culprit.
Some employees at theSonyCorp entertainment unit were given new computers to replace ones that had been attacked with the rare data-wiping virus, which had made their machines unable to operate, according to a person with knowledge of Sony’s operations.
In a memo to staff seen by Reuters, studio co-chiefs Michael Lynton and Amy Pascal acknowledged that “a large amount of confidential Sony Pictures Entertainment data has been stolen by the cyber attackers, including personnel information and business documents.”
They are “not yet sure of the full scope of information that the attackers have or might release,” according to the memo first reported by Variety, and encouraged employees to take advantage of identity protection services being offered.
Their concern underscores the severity of the breach, which experts say is the first major attack on a U.S. company to use a highly destructive class of malicious software that is designed to make computer networks unable to operate.
Government investigators led by the FBI are considering multiple suspects in the attack, including North Korea, according to a U.S. national security official with knowledge of the investigation.
The FBI said Tuesday that it is working with its counterparts in Sony’s home country of Japan in the investigation.
That comes after it warned U.S. businesses on Monday about hackers’ use of malicious software and suggested ways to defend themselves. The warning said some of the software used by the hackers had been compiled in Korean, but it did not discuss any possible connection to North Korea.
SONY’S TROUBLES
The hack, which was launched Nov. 24, only affected computers withMicrosoftCorp’s Windows software, so Sony employees usingAppleInc Macs, including many in the marketing department, had not been affected, according to the person familiar with Sony’s operations, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the attack.
Sony Pictures Entertainment shut down its internal computer network last week to prevent the data-wiping software from causing further damage, forcing employees to use paper and pen.
The studio has brought some systems back on line, focusing first on those from which the company generates revenues, including those involved with marketing and distributing its films and TV shows, according to the person.
The hack comes at a tough time for Sony, following soon after a denial-of-service attack on Sony’s PlayStation Network in August. Sony was also victim of a notorious 2011 breach that compromised data of tens of millions of PlayStation Network users.It also comes just as the company’s CEO Kazuo Hirai is trying to grow the entertainment business to help offset losses in its mobile division.
He has been under pressure to prove the segment’s growth potential after rejecting a proposal by U.S. hedge fund Third Point to spin it off last year.
FORENSIC INVESTIGATION
People claiming responsibility for this latest attack have posted high-quality digital copies of yet-to-be-released Sony films and what they claim are sensitive data about its operations and employees on Internet download sites, making them freely available to the public in a series of releases over the past five days.
Sony’s holiday musical “Annie”, which is due to be released Dec. 19 in the United States, was available for download on a popular piracy site on Tuesday evening.Daniel Clemens, chief executive of cyber security firm PacketNinjas, said he has reviewed the files released to date and believes they were stolen from Sony.He said he found business contracts as well as Social Security numbers, salary information and medical data about employees.
“This is a horrible compromise,” Clemens said.
The U.S. national security official, who asked to remain anonymous, told Reuters on Tuesday that the forensic investigation is in its early stages, and that no clear suspects have emerged.
The technology news site Re/code reported Nov. 28 that Sony was investigating whether hackers working on behalf of the North Korean government were responsible for the attack as retribution for the company’s backing of the film “The Interview.”
The comedy, which is due to be released in the United States and Canada on Dec. 25, is about a CIA plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Pyongyang denounced the film as “an act of war” in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in June.

"A jilted lover was arrested by the cyber crime cell of the Vadodara police Saturday for creating fake profile of a woman on a social networking site Facebook with the aim to malign her character by portraying her as a call girl.
The accused, Bhupendra Shah, a resident of Ghodasar inAhmedabad, allegedly usedFacebookas a means to take revenge on a divorced woman, who is a resident of Karelibaug in Vadodara, by creating three fake accounts and profiles and posting her photograph and mobile number on each of them. Police said Shah posted a message that suggested that the owner of the mobile number was a prostitute seeking clients through the social networking site.
“Shah created three accounts in the name of Poonam Shah, Nick Shah and Hasya Shah, and posted the mobile number of the victim on each of these accounts along with her photo and a message that suggested that she was seeking clients. Soon after, the victim started receiving calls form anonymous persons asking for her ‘rate’. Alerted, she asked from where they got her mobile number and learnt that her number was in circulation on social networking site,” said cyber crime cell PI VJ Rathod.
The victim lodged a police complaint and an investigation was launched. Soon, police sought details of the creator of the account from the Facebook and in a month and half, they learnt that the accused was behind creating the profile. Police booked him under various acts of the Information technology Act (2008) and Indian Penal Code for spreading obscene materials using computer device to malign the character of the victim.
Shah had got in touch with the victim nearly a year ago onYahooMessanger and both had exchanged numbers. The victim, divorcee, had refused to marry the accused and had married someone else. In order to take revenge for being jilted in love, he tried to malign her character using fake Facebook profile, police said.

"A fraudulent on-line job racket offering nurses jobs in the UK has been busted by the cyber crime police in Bangalore with the arrest of five persons including two Nigerians. The accused had cheated a nurse to the tune of Rs 11 lakh by promising her a job at the Ealing Hospital in the United Kingdom.
The accused have been identified as Prince John Chikere (39) and Chinemeze Bede alias Joshua (26), both Nigerian nationals, along with Jennie Vungneiniang (30) wife of Prince John, her friend Lalthlanzo (31) and T Douthanlian Simte (21), all three with origins in North-East India.
Cyber crime police authorities attached to theKarnatakaCID police unit said in an official note that a nurse from KGF in Karnataka had filed a complaint with the Cyber Crime Police station on May 5 stating that she had responded to an email job offer for nurses at the Ealing Hospital in the UK and had paid Rs 11 lakh for the job as suggested by the fraudsters.
The nurse had responded to the email job offer at the Ealing hospital in UK by sending her CV and educational certificates. The accused subsequently got in touch with the victim on her telephone and asked her to remit money for anti-terrorism and drug trafficking safety certificates, WHO immunization insurance and skilled immigration permit certificates.
The victim remitted Rs 11,03,500 to different bank accounts as suggested provided by the accused before she realized she had been conned by a gang of fraudsters when she stopped getting responses from the accused.
Police said that main accused Prince John came to India 14 years ago and settled inBangalore. Another accused Bede came to India and never returned despite the expiry of his visa. Bede who had settled in Bangalore was running the online cheating operation with the help of his associates, police said.

"52 per cent of the children surveyed in India said they were victims of cyber-crime (Source: Reuters)
With easy access to Internet and smart gadgets, a growing number of children in the country today are falling prey to cyber-bullying, security software firm Symantec said on Sunday.
However, more disturbing is the fact that a majority of the parents don’t feel their child is being bullied online.
According to a report by Norton (a Symantec brand), 52 per cent of the children surveyed in India said they were victims of cyber-crime and/or had online negative situation and about 18 per cent said they had been bullied online.
However, 84 per cent of the parents surveyed in India said they did not feel that their child was being bullied online, The Norton Report: Family Edition said.
Cyber-bullying refers to people using electronic communication like emailing, social networking and texting to harm others.
Interestingly, 34 per cent of children surveyed in India admitted to creating negative online experience for others.
Negative online experience refers to experience someone posting private/intimate content without permission, being approached online in an unwanted sexual way, online stalking or harassment, receiving SMS text messages from unknown people asking to click on an embedded link or receiving adult content.
“Going online is a daily affair for many of us, not just adults but children too as they tackle schoolwork and indulge in playtime on the Internet. With social media and the online world continuing to infiltrate our lives and that of children, cyber-bullying remains a very real online danger due to the damaging effect on people’s mental health,” Ritesh Chopra, Country Manager (India) for Norton by Symantec told.
Also, with more and more people using their mobile devices, there is more direct impact.
“Unlike offline forms of communication, these chats and messages are being digitally stored and can be forwarded to someone other than the original recipient, edited to distort the communication, and be published to different places,” he said.
Once the communication is “out there,” the person has lost control of it, Chopra added.
About 54 per cent of the girls surveyed said they were victims of cyber-crime or a negative online situation.
Also, 58 per cent girls said they were bullied online during school year compared to 28 per cent boys who said they were bullied in school year.
The study, commissioned annually by Symantec, surveyed 13,022 adults (aged 18 to 64) from 24 countries in 2014.This includes Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Italy,Japan, the UAE, the UK and the US.

"Months after whistleblower Edward Snowden disclosed that snooping by United States intelligence agencies involved internet networks in India, the government has acknowledged that only metadata or the “origin-route-destination” of emails were tracked and not their “actual content”.
In a report “Cyber Crime, Cyber Security and Right to Privacy”, tabled in Parliament in the last session by the Standing Committee on Information Technology, the Secretary of the Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DEITY) said that the government has been “assured that whatever data has been gathered by them for surveillance relates only to the metadata”. “It has been reiterated and stated at the highest level of the US President that only the metadata has been accessed, which is, the origin of the message and the receiving point, the destination and the route through which it has gone, but not the actual content itself,” the Secretary told the committee.
He said “this has been reiterated by them, but we expressed that any incursion into the content will not be tolerated and is not tolerable from Indian stand and point of view” and “that has been mentioned very clearly and firmly by our Government”. The committee, while taking note of DEITY’s stand that “incursion into the content of the country’s data will not be tolerated”, said that the “department should have exercised enough caution so that such a situation was not allowed to occur at the first instance”.Asking the department to be “extremely vigilant and cautious” in terms of safety and policy with different countries so as to avoid “such leakage and interception of sensitive data in the name of surveillance”, the panel has called for “remedial measures” and “a policy which should be implemented stringently so as to obviate recurrence of such instances”.

"With high demand for IT jobs in the city and the Middle East, Hyderabad has become the hub for job frauds and online employment scams. While well-educated scamsters are duping unemployed graduates of lakhs of rupees by promising jobs in top IT companies, con men in the old city are taking Muslims youths for a ride by assuring them jobs in the Middle East. From just one case of defrauding job-seekers in 2012, the number of job scams rose to 21 in 2013. This year, seven cases have been registered already.
On January 15, Central Crime Station officers arrested the CEO of a job consultancy in Ameerpet. The accused, V Chandrasekhar, collected close to Rs 30 lakh from 19 persons promising them jobs in Bahrain. He convinced them to pay “consultation and processing fee” after arranging fake telephonic interviews with his friend living in London. “They are all innocent youths desperate to get a job. Once they paid the money, Chandrasekhar started avoiding them and stopped answering their calls,’’ inspector P Raju said. Of the 19 victims, 10 are Muslim youths from poor families who apparently borrowed money or mortgaged family jewellery.
Cyber Crime and CCS officials say tfraudsters are not only using employment websites but are also openly posting job offers on websites likeOLXandQuikr, besides shopping websites. Also under police scanner are severalHyderabad-based websites offering fake degree and employment experience certificates. According to the Hyderabad Police, cyber crimes showed an almost 350% increase from 47 cases in 2012, to 162 cases in 2013.
Recently, police arrested a man who was offering jobs in the Hyderabad office of a top IT multi-national company. He posted the offer on a classifieds website. Posing as an HR executive ofIBM, he duped a woman of Rs 80,000 by creating a fake email ID that led the victim to believe the appointment letter was sent by the company. Based on a complaint, the Cyberabad Police arrested P Rajendran, who was in the process of duping other people at that time. Officials say that almost all major IT companies in Hyderabad find their names being used by con men, the latest beingDell, Genpact and Infosys.
“Supporting these fraudsters are several ancillary agencies which provide them with fake visas, forged letterheads of various companies, fake certificates and even fake air-tickets,’’ said a CCS official. Last month, the Commissioner’s Task Force raided a visa consultancy in Secunderabad and arrested its owner, G Krishna, who was preparing fake F1 visas.

"Seven month long country-wide chase by the Mumbai Police last year ended with the arrest of 13 people, including the alleged masterminds of the illegal transfer of Rs 2.4 crore from the Yes Bank account of the RP Geonka Group of firms in May.
While the plotters of the cyber fraud have been identified as Nigerian nationals, a church priest fromTamil Naduis also a key figure in the conspiracy, the police have said. The police are convinced that the crime has its origins in one of thousands of spam e-mails sent daily by the Nigerian accused. Police officers who supervised the investigation believe that one such Trojan-bearing e-mail was opened by an employee of the RPG group, allowing the accused to access the firm’s bank account details.
In a series of 14 transfers in three hours on May 11, Rs 2.4. crore was illegally siphoned off and deposited in 12 bank accounts in 10 cities. The receivers were instructed only to withdraw the money credited to their accounts and allowed to retain a percentage, the police said.
After thea transactions came to light, RPG Group instructed Yes Bank to stop them. Yes Bank, in turn, informed other banks to freeze the accounts of the receivers. It ensured that part of the amount could not be withdrawn.
Once Yes Bank officials handed over details of the account-holders, the Worli police had the seemingly straight-forward task of going to their homes and recovering the cash.  “Almost all of the addresses turned out to be false. When we went to the addresses, the account-holders were not home,” said Inspector Jeevan Kharat of the Worli police station. Kharat headed a special squad formed by the then Central Region Additional Commissioner of Police, Pravin Salunke.
The police did succeed in nabbingHyderabad-based businessmen Venkata Reddy (26) and Pawan Waghmare (44) in Coimbatore in June. The men, who operate a small firm selling agricultural implements, planned to use Rs. 3 lakh they had been paid, to expand their business interests.
Another police team, meanwhile, traced the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer used to commit the offence. It led them to a small apartment in Saket in south Delhi, where Nigerian nationals Alumona Chukwudi (38) and Ogwu Ransom (37) were holed up. A laptop and an MTS internet dongle were seized from their possession.
With Chukwudi and Ransom at the top of the chain, the police found a network of middlemen spread across the country, engaged in coaxing gullible bank customers into lending their accounts for receiving money. The police identified and arrested one among them – Solomon Prabhakar Duraiswami, a native of Thiruvallur district in Tamil Nadu. The police said 37-year-old Duraiswami is responsible for acquiring bank accounts in Coimbatore, Kanchipuram and Thiruvallur for the accused.
“These middlemen never gave out their full names or phone numbers. They would usually pose as poor people without bank accounts and tell their targets that they needed to receive money either from family living in another state or from a trust. In return, they would promise their targets a small percentage of the sum,” said Vinayak Deshmukh, Deputy commissioner of Police, Zone 3.
Investigations into the acquisition of the internet dongle led to further arrests and unearthed another part of the conspiracy.The police tracked down an MTS Gallery in Saket, where two employees, Raju Kirodiwal (30) and Rahul Mishra (26), surreptitiously acquired internet connections using details of new customers. “Both men had asked two new customers to submit copies of their driver’s license and address proof. They used one copy of each document and acquired dongles, which were then passed on to an MTS agent named Sudhir Sudhan,” said Kharat.
Sudhan, 35, supplied several such dongles to  cell phone stalls in Saket. “We arrested two men, Manish Arora (37) and Amjad Khan (42) for selling the dongles used in the offence, to the main accused. The accused disposed off the dongles after committing the crime,” said Kharat.

"The state government on Monday ordered a probe into active use of Facebook accounts and cyber life of members of a supari gang who have been in judicial custody for last 17 months on charges of murdering a CPI (M) rebel leader. The seven-member gang was among the CPI (M) leaders who have been facing trial in the murder of Marxist rebel T P Chandrasekharan in May last year.
The alleged accused in the murder case are now lodged in Kozhikode district jail. Two months back,a kingpin of the gold smuggling gang from Dubai,named Fayas,had visited the accused in jail in the attire of an Arab national. The state intelligence had earlier reported about the alleged accused using phones at the jail.
The gang was found frequently updating their photos about life in jail and liking the CPI (M) events,including last weeks party plenum. They had posted photos in flamboyant styles. One of the accused Annan Sijith had posted a comment 15 hours back,saying dont play with the CPI (M). (It may be recalled that aBJPworker was murdered in Kannur on Sunday). The pictures also showed the gang members using costly smart phones in jail.
The security lapses at the jail and the freedom enjoyed by the pro-CPI (M) gang have evoked widespread protest from Congress leaders. Congress MP from Kannur K Sudhakaran said the incident exposed the failure of the Home Department. Sudhakaran has been running a battle with his party colleague and home minister Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan over the governments police policy. Radhakrishnan should answer for this blatant violation of prison rules. It is shocking that the CPI (M) goons have such a freedom to violet prisons rules when Congress is in power, said Sudhakaran.
Home Minister Radhakrishnan said he would visit the jail on Tuesday. A high-level committee,comprising the Prisons DGP,the DGP (law and order) and the Home Secretary would probe into the issue.

"Phishing scam racket mastermind Muzammil Tazdar has reportedly told police that over the past two years,he had built a multi-layered network of fall guys around himself to ensure that his scams were not traced back to him,using three-four people between himself and his victims. Police said he started his career in crime around two years ago after being mentored by another expert cyber criminal.
Tazdar,who had injured himself while trying to evade arrest earlier this month,was formally arrested Wednesday after he was discharged fromGTHospital. He had allegedly transferred Rs 12.5 lakh from actor Raveena Tandons husband Anil Thadanis account to his own. He was involved in similar crimes in Thane,NaviMumbaiand Nashik,police said.
Tazdar aspired to be a model. We have found an entire portfolio of modelling photographs among his belongings. However,he could not succeed as a model. Around two-and-a half years ago,he met a man identified as Rinku Sabharwal,who,according to Tazdar,is an expert in crimes involving hacking and phishing. Sabharwal allegedly trained Tazdar and Tazdar started committing such crimes in 2011. We are checking if Sabharwal has a record, said an officer with the Mumbai Police Crime Branch.
On Sabharwals advice,Tazdar started building up a network of people that he could use for the more dangerous activities such as personally contacting potential victims and withdrawing money from his accounts after the victims money had been transferred.
Tazdar has been remanded in police custody till Sunday,sources said.

"The cyber crime cell of city police has managed to trace the beneficiary account used by the racketeers to allegedly dupe Sanjay Dhande (65),former director of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT),Kanpur,of Rs 19 lakh through an online fraud.  Dhande is a also member of National Security Advisory Board and is a recipient of Padma Shri award.
The police arrested  Vinayak Mahadev Trilotkar,a resident of Lower Parel,who had opened the account at a reputed bank in Fort area ofMumbai,with the help of Dhande and IIT students.
Trilotkar,reportedly works as a marketing executive with a private firm. Police said racketeers had promised to give Trilotkar three per cent of the money they were transferring to his account.
Police said money to the tune of Rs 19 lakh was transferred from Dhandes account in Aundh branch of ICICI Bank in the first week of September this year without his knowledge. The fraud came to light when he was informed by the bank that his deposits in the account have gone below a certain limit. He registered a complaint under Sections of Information Technology (IT) Act at the Chatushringi police station on September 14.
Investigations revealed that money from his account was transferred to eleven bank accounts – three inWest Bengal,three inUttar Pradesh,two
inRajasthanand three in
Mumbai.
Police suspect racketeers allegedly obtained a duplicate SIM card on the same number used by Dhande and then blocked it following which he stopped receiving SMS alerts about transactions taking place from his account. As many as 22 transactions,including six cash transfers,took place from his account.
Investigation revealed that racketeers opened beneficiary accounts for committing fraud. Police suspect that Trilotkars account was managed by racketeers and he is believed to have got three percent of the amount. Search is on for the kingpins and also for holders of similar beneficiary accounts in other states. Police inspector Sanjay Tungar is investigating the case.
Meanwhile,a magistrate court remanded Trilotkar in police custody till October 14.

"A US jury has indicted 13 members of the Internet hacking group Anonymous for allegedly carrying out cyber-attacks worldwide,including targets that refused to process payments for WikiLeaks,the anti-secrecy website founded by Julian Assange.
The US-based members of Anonymous are accused of zeroing in on the computers of governments,trade associations,law firms,financial institutions and other institutions that oppose the philosophy of Anonymous to make all information free for everyone,regardless of copyright laws or national security considerations.
The indictment Thursday filed in federal court says that from September 2010 to January 2011,Anonymous members participated in a campaign they called Operation Payback,using software known as the Low Orbit Ion Cannon to flood websites with huge amounts of Internet traffic to shut them down.
In December 2010,the conspirators discussed possible targets related to WikiLeaks,which received more than 700,000 documents and some battlefield video from Army Pvt. Chelsea Manning,the largest-volume leak of classified material in US history.
Anonymous focused on websites that were either critical of WikiLeaks or had refused to process payments for WikiLeaks,among them MasterCard and Visa. The targets even included the Swedish prosecutor's office,in connection with arrest warrants for sexual crimes issued for Assange.
Members of Anonymous launched what they called Operation Payback,an attack on the Motion Picture Industry of America,the Recording Industry Association of America,the British Phonographic Industry and others. The attacks were retaliation against the discontinuation of 'The Pirate Bay,' a Sweden-based file sharing website devoted to the illegal downloading of copyrighted material.
According to the indictment,Anonymous then moved against others such as ACS-Law,a British law firm helping clients to protect intellectual property rights; Anti-piracy.nl,the website for the BREIN foundation,a Dutch trade association fighting intellectual property theft; and the Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft.
The website of the US Copyright Office at the Library of Congress was the subject of a multiday cyber-attack.
The 13 members of Anonymous were charged with conspiring to intentionally cause damage to protected computers.
Nine people have been arrested in the Porsche accident case, including the 17-year-old driver whose blood sample was swapped with his mother's at Sassoon Hospital.

"A large community of tech-savvy students in Pune has fuelled a spike in cyber crime in the city. According to figures released by the Maharashtra Police on Monday,Pune tops the state in the number of cyber crimes.
Police said 108 cases were registered inPuneunder the IT Act,2000,last year. While Thane city followed with 89 cases,33 cases were registered inMumbai. Pune also led in the number of arrests made (52),while 37 people were arrested in Thane city,30 in Bhandara and 20 in Aurangabad.
Police and cyber security experts point to Punes burgeoning educational institutes that attract students from all over India and abroad. Predictably,of the arrested accused,215 were in the age group of 18 to 30,while 75 were aged between 30 and 45. With Internet being accessible to even children,nine of the accused were below 18 years.
Pune is an education hub with a lot more universities and institutes than Mumbai. The city also has a younger crowd with easy access to technology. The age of those committing cyber crimes is coming down, said cyber security expert Vijay Mukhi.
Mumbai topped the state for cyber crimes registered under the IPC.
As many as 72 cases were filed and 54 people arrested in 2012,while Navi Mumbai was second with 12 cases and 18 arrests.
The number of cyber crimes also increased in 2012 compared to 2011. As many as 417 cases were registered under the IT Act in 2012 as opposed to 324 in 2011. The number of crimes under the IPC also increased from 87 in 2011 to 90 in 2012.
Last year also witnessed a sharp rise in the cases of hacking computer systems. As many as 192 cases of hacking and causing destruction to computer resources were registered compared to 68 in 2011. The number of arrests also rose from 89 to 46 in the corresponding period. Disgruntled employees were under the scanner in 11 cases in Mumbai,10 in Pune city,and four in Nagpur.
Accessing a computer system without permission amounts to hacking. For those working in IT companies and BPOs,it is easy to use a pen drive and take official documents, said an official in the Mumbai Police cyber lab.
Making illegal gains and committing fraud were found to be the major motives behind crimes,with 63 cases in Mumbai,21 in Pune city and 14 in Navi Mumbai being attributed to this,figures showed. Cases of online forgery also rose to 76 in 2012 from 67 in 2011,but arrests decreased to 57 from 62 in the corresponding period.
A majority of these cases were committed by persons known to the victim. Detection in cyber crime cases is difficult, the official said.

"In view of growing cyber crime in the region,the Ghaziabad police plans to launch a special cyber crime cell,which will have exclusive jurisdiction over these cases.
A senior police officer said the move was necessitated by the expertise required to crack cases of online forgery,software piracy and other cyber crime.
The cell will train personnel and bring in modernised equipment to track cyber crimes,the officer said.
A senior police officer said: With the changing nature of crimes in the city,it is important to update equipment . It is practically impossible for investigating officers from police stations to make headway in these cases without the adequate technical know how.
According to the police,there have been more than 100 cases of cyber crimes since the turn of the year.
A senior officer said the cell would lay emphasis on crimes such as online stalking,instances of which are increasing rapidly.
With the cell,we will not only be able to track down the offenders and apprehend them,but also delete objectionable content. To track down offenders is important,as [objectionable material online often leads to other crimes and several instances of suicide due to harassment, the officer said.
Police said professional cyber trainers were being recruited to impart knowledge on these aspects to the police personnel.
Crimes such as hacking,child pornography,stalking,virus dissemination,software piracy,credit card fraud and internet extortion will be part of the training imparted. Further,we are looking to bring in the requisite equipment and are in the process of drawing up plans for the same, an officer said.

"Police authorities have called for allocation of powers to tackle the gutkha ban. Bhanupratap Barge,senior inspector at the social security cell said there were frequent clashes between the FDA and police pertaining to taking action. At times,he said,precious time is wasted when cops have to wait for the FDA officials during panchnama process.
Notification on the gutkha ban is awaited. Most manufacturers have moved their production units toKarnatakaand other states. Hence,we will have to maintain a vigil to check smuggling of the packets in the state, Barge said. He also stressed that all the states in the country need to ban gutkha if smuggling is to be stopped.
Sanjay Shinde,deputy commissioner of police (Cyber Crime and Economic Offences Wing) said,In the past one year,we have registered 21 cases against hookah parlours. We have also cracked down on illegal sale of gutkha. We took action based on tip-offs or complaints that we received.
As per the existing laws,even principals of schools and colleges have adequate powers. But we will wait for the detailed notification on the latest decision on the ban. We need to know which agency has the power of taking action. Police will play their role as designated by the government.
When contacted,Patil said the notification will be issued soon.
FDA commissioner Mahesh Zagade said a state-level action plan was being prepared. The initiative to ban gutkha and paan masala is significant and several organisations and individuals,including Minister of State for Home Satej Patil,Tata Memorial Hospital doctors like Pankaj Chaturvedi andPune-based Dr Kalyan Gangwal,have played a big role,he said.
According to Patil,gutkha ban will not only save 85 lakh lives but also billions of rupees that are otherwise spent on treatment of health issues related to consumption of gutkha.
Gutkha,paan masala and tobacco-based products are posing serious health problems inMaharashtra. While paan masala is predominantly composed of areca nut (supari),gutkha is a combination of smokeless tobacco and areca nut. As per the Global Adult Tobacco Survey released by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare,in 2010,1.7 crore Maharashtrians above 18 years of age were consuming smokeless tobacco. According to WHO,every second tobacco user dies prematurely.

"In the backdrop of rising cyber crime,Home Minister P Chidambaram disclosed on Monday that the government proposed to create a national structure for cyber security and establish a National Threat Intelligence Centre.
No one is immune to cyber crime and attacks, he said,recalling that there had been cyber attacks on the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO),CBI and other government infrastructure.
Discussions have been held and we are at an advanced stage of creating a national structure for cyber security. We are also thinking of setting up a National Threat Intelligence Centre, Chidambaram said.
Launching a report on cyber security prepared by software industry body Nasscom,he said there was a need to build capacity in various law enforcement agencies in cyber crime investigations and cyber forensics.
Chidambaram said dimensions of security problem increased manifold in the online space and we have to build lawful interception capabilities.
The report,’Securing Our Cyber Frontiers’,by Nasscom and Data Security Council of India (DSCI) presented to Chidambaram by outgoing Nasscom Chairman Rajendra Pawar,has suggested setting up a national structure for cyber security,which would clearly define the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders.
It has also recommended establishing a National Threat Intelligence Centre,which would integrate all existing information sources.
We have taken numerous steps to protect the physical infrastructure…I think all that we have done to protect the infrastructure in the physical space seems to be a lighter task than when we face threats that have been outlined in the cyber space, he said.
Chidambaram said the dimension of the security problem grows manifold in crimes on cyber space with offences such as identity theft,hacking,financial fraud,child pornography and corporate espionage.
From national security point of view,this is an important report and law enforcement agencies should quickly scale up capacity to deal with these new crimes, he said.
The minister,however,said some of the recommendations overlap with several ongoing initiatives of the government.
Nasscom and DSCI had constituted the Cyber Security Advisory Group (CSAG),under the chairmanship of Rajendra Pawar,Kamlesh Bajaj (DSCI CEO) as Member Secretary and experts from public and private sector and law enforcement.
The Group was mandated to come up with recommendations for consideration by the government on public-private partnership in capacity building and policy making.
Attacks on critical infrastructure supporting technology can have effects similar to those achieved by traditional wars. I believe the report will help the government create policy instruments and public-private partnership models for enhancing cyber security in the country, Pawar said.
Chidambaram said work is underway to prepare inventory critical information infrastructure. Testing labs for accreditation of ICT products are also being set up.
Cyber space is a national asset…the way forward is obviously to work together. While the government and government agencies will remain principal players,the undeniable fact is that there are millions of private players and the challenge to cyber security can not be met unless they work together, he said.
Other recommendations include designing and implementing a competency framework and setting up a Centre of Excellence for best practice in cyber security,besides establishing a cyber command within the defence forces.
The cyber command should be equipped with defensive and offensive cyber weapons and manpower trained in cyber warfare, the report said.

"A matrimonial dispute between a Non-Resident Indian (NRI) from Ahmedabad and his wife,from Gurgaon in Haryana,hit cyberspace after the husband allegedly created a website by the name of his wife and posted photos and other evidence on it,alleging that he was tortured by her. Taking objection to this,the woman has registered a cyber-offence with Gurgaon police against her husband under the provisions of the Information Technology (IT) Act.
Based on the complaint,Gurgaon police had issued a look-out notice against the husband who was recently detained for a few hours atAhmedabadInternational Airport and was let go with a condition not to leave India.
The NRI is Raj Trivedi from Ahmedabad and his wife is Bhavna Sachdev. They married in August 2009 after connecting on a matrimonial website. Trivedi is an NRI settled at Houston in the United States and he has been into the business of commodities.
According to Trivedi,after a short span of married life,they had started to have disputes which resulted in Bhavna lodging a criminal complaint of dowry,domestic violence and harassment against him,his parents and sister. He also added that a litigation related to the complaint is pending before Punjab & Haryana High Court as the court has sent it for mediation.
In the matrimonial dispute,Bhavna has accused Raj,his parents and his sister of dowry,domestic violence and harassment. Whereas,Raj has alleged that his wife is after his property by defrauding him.
After the dowry complaint registered against him,Raj had created a website by the name of his wife and posted all the ‘evidence’ in his possession against her on the website. Taking strong objection,Bhavna booked him under IT Act,on February 1.
Bhavna,in her complaint,has stated that the act of Raj has invaded her privacy and accused him of libel and defamation. She further stated that Raj has posted documents on those cases which are still running in court. During this event he has repeatedly tortured and threatened me that he will try to defame me publicly by putting my picture/information on internet and now he has actually done this…, she added in the complaint.
Following the complaint,the website has been made unavailable on the internet.
Raj,on his part for creating the website,said,In the dowry complaint,the police was not treating me fairly,was harassing me and I was fearing for my life. And so,I posted that material on website to let my family members and friends know about the evidence in the case in case something happens to me. Also,I wanted to send out a warning message to people about the dangers of entering into a marriage through internet.
When contacted byThe Indian Expressin connection with the case,Bhavna refused to comment saying it is not right for her to speak on a matter that is sub-judice.

"While cyber criminals move at the speed of light,the police move at the speed of law. Adam Palmer,Norton lead cyber security adviser and one of the worlds top cyber crime prosecutors,is very precise when he explains why India,where 80 per cent adult internet users have been victims of cyber crime,has not been able to tackle the growing menace successfully.
The scale of cyber crime in India is enormous. Last year,the country lost about $7.6 billion  $4 billion in cash and the rest in time  to cyber attacks. Palmer says that with their ever-growing digital infrastructure,developing countries like India,China and Brazil are fast becoming the launchpads for cyber attacks. This also means that internet users in these countries have been targeted for a bulk of these attacks.
The law is constantly playing a bit of catch-up,so all countries need to create laws that are flexible and adapt to the situation. This is the challenge for all governments, says Palmer,who has worked extensively with the FBI and other law-enforcement agencies to promote anti-cyber crime initiatives and promote consumer awareness about the threats.
There is no one-size-fits-all solution to cyber security. The response has to be very specific. There are certain situations where even a military response would be appropriate,like in cases of cyber terrorism,but it would be giving these criminals undue credit if we call them soldiers,non-government actors. Often this is a law-enforcement issue as we are dealing with criminals. These are just old crimes being committed in newer,faster ways.
But the problem is taking epidemic proportions. The staggering scale of the world of cyber crime is clear when you consider that there are 1 million victims every day,twice the number of babies born the world over. Last year,this added up to $388 billion in time and cash lost the world over. There are 14 victims of cyber crime every second,not surprising when you realise that nine malicious software are created every second, says Effendy Ibrahim,Internet Safety Advocate and Symantec Asias Consumer Business Director.
Palmer says that while there is no doubt about the need to educate users about the impending threats in cyber space,judges,prosecutors and the police also need to be trained on how to investigate these cases and secure justice for the victims. Indian authorities are already working in tandem with international agencies to upgrade the skills of their investigators,he adds. To succeed in fighting cyber crime we must first properly define the problem… The solution,in many cases,is continuing to support increased law-enforcement capability to successfully find and prosecute cybercriminals.
The popularity of mobile devices to access the Web has added another dimension to the problem. With open source software likeAndroidcommanding 40 per cent of the smart phone market,anyone can now upload apps with malicious content. Mobile devices are lucrative targets for cyber criminals as they combine personal and business data. Almost 10 per cent of mobile users have been victims of cyber attacks,but still they tend to trust whatever comes on their phones, says Palmer,adding that even people who are very careful with their computers often take mobile phone security for granted. The risk is high in a country like India which has about 800 million mobile phones users and hardly anyone uses mobile security software.
The recent malicious virus links onFacebook,which put thousands of users in an embarrassing situation,shows what has become the latest playground of cyber criminals. Often cyber criminals use social networking sites to gain trust and misuse the personal information posted on these sites, says Palmer,explaining why users have to be very careful about what they put up on such sites.
Since 43 per cent of Indians using the Internet say they wont be able to live without it,it is time for them to be proactive,he says. It is better to think of ways to prevent attacks and make ourselves more secure than thinking of what is to done after such an incident. While we need good laws,it is also necessary for people to become proactive. In fact,43 per cent of Indians dont use updated security software to protect their devices. We have to realise that cost of cyber security is trivial when compared to the financial damage it can cause, adds Palmer.

"Only 1 case registered; in all other instances parties compromise
*A girl created a fake profile of her roommate posting indecent remarks about her. This was done post an altercation between the two.
*An employee of an IT firm created a fakeFacebookprofile of his female colleague and posted wrong information that she is getting married because she is pregnant.
*A boy created a fake Facebook account and posted girls mobile number on the account inviting obscene phone calls from anonymous persons
These are just samples of the nearly four dozen complaints received by theChandigarhCyber Crime Cell with regard to misuse of Facebook accounts. Against the 46 complaints received this year the Cyber Crime Cell registered only one case because in all the other cases the parties involved entered into a compromise. Incidentally,majority of the victims are girls.
The complainants in most of the cases have refused to pursue their complaints after preliminary investigation revealed that their friends and known ones were involved in the creation/misuse of the fake profile.
The complaints are mainly involving youngsters who find and effective medium to avenge their strained relationship with their known. The major reasons for the creation of fake profile are generally matrimonial dispute,business rivalry or just college and school fights.
Inspector Neeraj Sarna,Head,Chandigarh Police Cyber Crime Cell,said,We have been receiving cases regarding fake profile on a regular basis. The majority of complainants are from youngsters and people involved in the Information Technology sector. In most of the cases the near and dear ones of the victims are involved. A major part of the complaints are involving creation of fake profile of girls.
Recently a software engineer from Bhiwani was arrested for creating a fake FB profile of his wife. The accused also engaged in vulgar conversation with other people from the fake profile. Investigation revealed that the couple were involved in a matrimonial dispute.
Creation of a fake Profile or identity theft which is covered under Section 66a of the Information Technology Act (IT Act) is a bailable offence. If a person is also engaging in posting vulgar and wrong information about the victim then they can be punished for a minimum of three years.
The youngest person involved in the creation of a fake profile was a class X boy residing in Sector 21. He had created a fake FB profile of a girl studying in his school.

"Accused of hacking into Dells systems to raise his salary and that of his two colleagues,Deepak Sharma (25) was presented in Mohali courts on Wednesday and was remanded to judicial custody till October 19. He was arrested by the Cyber Crime wing of the Punjab Crime Branch on Tuesday.
Deepak,who previously worked in Client Technical Support inDellcomputers was told not to report for duty from September 20 due to some sales order inquiry pending against him. The accused apparently hacked the official mail of Human Resource Generalist Pratish Patnayak,by using the administrative login to enter the system from his personal computer and then used the official ID of his senior to increase the salary of his colleagues. Later he used the same ID to increase his salary twice – first an increase of 25 percent followed by another hike of 140 percent.
Speaking to Newsline,Inspector Charanjeev Lamba,Investigating Officer said,The accused first used Patnayaks ID to increase the salary of Geetanjali and Peter Simon and when he found it to be working,he gave himself a salary hike.
Lamba said that Dell authorities conducted an internal inquiry into the matter and when Sharmas hand was suspected he was summoned to the office on September 29 where he confessed to his crime and asked to be pardoned,but the authorities went ahead and complained to the Cyber wing. The police have seized the computer of the accused along with the computer he accessed in the company. The role of any other person has not been found.
A case was registered against the accused on October 3 on the complaint of site director Prabhakar Raju.

"Fired for misconduct from Dell Computers,25-year-old Deepak Sharma decided to deal directly. With a view to earning higher salary from another company,Sharma hacked into the Human Resource database of his previous employer and tripled his last drawn pay.
To authenticate his fraud,Sharma also hiked the salaries of a few other employees and gave them promotions by changing their profiles in the database and also sent emails from the account of the head of the HR department.
But Sharmas tryst with hacking didnt last long and he was caught in the web of the Cyber Crime wing of the Punjab Police. He has been booked under relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act and remanded in one-day police custody by a Mohali court.
Belonging to a lower middle-class family,Sharma,who has studied only up to plus two,was employed withDellComputers for his computer expertise. He was sacked from the company on September 20 on charges of misconduct.
Five days later,Deepak hacked the database and also the official mail account of HR Department. After making the necessary interpolations in the database,he shot off emails to the employees from the account of HR head announcing promotions and hike in salaries. This,Deepak did in order to benefit himself by tripling his salary so that he could bargain a higher salary in another company. Also,he sent emails to others announcing their promotions so that nobody suspects his mischief, said SSP (Crime) Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh.
Police officials said Deepak did this also to avenge his sacking. He was drawing a salary of around Rs 35,000 in Dell,which he tripled by hacking the email of the HR department.
The case had reached the police after a complaint suspecting hacking was lodged by Prabhakar Raju,a senior officer with Dell. Raju had alleged that somebody had made unauthorised access on the system and used internal mail ID of the Human Resource department.
Raju also alleged that he had noticed that some employees had been given promotion and undue salary hike by manipulating the system files. In this process,the salary of a particular employee was raised by 140 per cent which was unusual and undue. Many more such unauthorised transactions were made in the system.
It has been established beyond doubt that Deepak committed all the manipulations. The police seized his home computer which was used to make these unauthorised changes. The motive behind this act was to take revenge for his removal from the company, Vijay Pratap said.

"Even after getting abused publicly on the Traffic polices Facebook page for over two months; the Chandigarh Police has yet not been able to find the person responsible for it.
The failure is shocking considering that the police has a full-fledged Cyber Crime Investigation Cell functional under the banner of Crime Branch – the city polices premier investigating wing.
Chandigarhpolice claim that they are investigating to check the credentials of the user who had been using unparliamentary and abusive language on theFacebookpage.
Deputy Inspector General of police Chandigarh,Alok Kumar said,We are examining the matter so that legal action can be initiated against the user.
A second rung police officer said that the user,now under the police scanner,has been operating his Facebook account with various names for the last few months.
He would first upload the unparliamentary language on the Facebook page and also abuse the police on some other occasions. He would later delete those posts, the officer said.
The Facebook page of the Chandigarh Traffic Police was launched by Inspector General of Police Pradeep Kumar Srivastava,on June 4 with an objective to discipline the traffic violators. It was also supposed to be more interactive as netizens would frequently post traffic violations and suggestions about traffic on the page.
After the page was launched,the Chandigarh traffic police has issued nearly one thousand challan slips against violators whose pictures of evident traffic violations were uploaded on the page by the netizens.
But there is this one user who has been creating fuss one way or the other by using unparliamentary language. He would deleting these posts later. And he would even challenge the police saying they cannot act against him. We have compiled a detailed report about his posts, the police officer said.
We were looking into the case and investigating the credentials of the user whether the user was using a fake name or not, said the officer.
Police said that user had even been befriending those net users who uploaded pictures of violation on the page. But this user would later post their name and other details on the page, the police officer said.
The police officer said that they will not allow any one to use the Facebook page of Chandigarh Traffic Police as a platform hurl abuses to anyone.
Police sources said that the Cyber Crime cell has also started an investigation to trace the user.

"In the biggest ever series of cyber attacks uncovered to date,hackers were found to have broken into networks of the Indian government,United Nations and US defence companies,with security experts pointing to China as the culprit.
Targets for the intrusions in a five-year campaign covered 72 major organisations around the world,including the governments of India,US,South Korea,Vietnam,ASEAN,IOC and the world anti-doping agency,’The Washington Post’ reported,quoting a McAfee report.
The networks breached included UN secretariat in Geneva,a US Energy Department lab and 12 major US defence firms engaged in top secret futuristic weapons system,the report said.
The cyber snooping appears to have been going on for several years, the report said,tracing the hacking to at least one state actor behind the attack,but declined to name it,though the security experts said the evidence pointed to China.
We were taken aback by the audacity of the perpetrators, McAfee vice president Dmitri Alperovitch said in a 14-page sensational report released today.
What is happening to all this data… is still largely an open question. However,if even a fraction of it is used to build better competing products or beat competitors at key negotiations,the loss will represent a massive economic threat, he said.
Alperovitch said McAfee had notified all 72 victims of cyber attacks,which were now under investigations by law enforcement agencies around the world.
He declined to give the names of the departments of the governments hacked or give more details of the companies infiltrated.
This is the biggest transfer of intellectual property in history and the scale at which this is occurring is really frightening, the McAfee official said.
McAfee said that it had come across the extent of hacking in May and had dubbed the uncovering of the plot as ‘Operation Shady RAT’.
The company said its researchers discovered logs of the attack while reviewing the contents of a command and control server as part of its investigations into security breaches of defence companies.

"With Internet becoming a new tool for terrorists,India and the US on Tuesday today decided to promote closer cooperation and timely exchange of information to fight cyber crimes.
According to a statement by the US Embassy here,the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) in this regard.
The agreement was signed by Jane Holl Lute,Deputy Secretary for the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and India Department of Information Technology Secretary R Chandrashekhar.
The MoU will establish the best practices for exchange of critical cyber security information and expertise between the two governments through the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) and the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT).
CERT-In is the India’s nodal agency for responding to cyber security incidents.
US-CERT serves as the operational arm of DHS National Cyber Security Division.
The MoU helps fulfill the commitment of both nations to advancing the global security and countering terrorism,one of the pillars of the US-India Strategic Dialogue,launched on July 20,2009.
The respective governments and cyber security communities in the US and India will now have the ability to coordinate with each other on a broad range of technical and operational cyber issues.
IT and Communication Minister Kapil Sibal later in the day met US security officials and discussed matters related to cyber security.
India,like many other countries,faces new security threats from the cyber world,especially in the aftermath of increasing convergence of technologies. There are serious concerns that terrorists might hack the department portals to and cripple the government functions.
Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano had travelled to India in May to launch the US-India Homeland Security Dialogue (HSD) with Home Minister P Chidambaram. This was the first comprehensive bilateral dialogue on homeland security issues between the US and India.
During Napolitano’s visit,the two countries had agreed to create the MoU,and negotiations for the non-binding arrangements.
US-CERT’s mission is to improve the nation’s cyber security posture,coordinate cyber information sharing and proactively manage cyber risks to the nation while protecting the constitutional rights of Americans.

"Five Nigerians and an Indian woman have been arrested for allegedly cheating a Hyderabad-based B Tech student to the tune of Rs 18.73 lakh by luring him through an email fraud that claimed he had won a prize money of 7.5 lakh pounds,police said on Tuesday.
They were apprehended from the metropolis byHyderabadPolice with assistance from theirMumbaicounterparts.
Believing them,the victim,G Amit Kumar,deposited Rs 18.73 lakh in cash on different occasions since March to get the reward money,which he never received.
In the first week of April,the 19-year-old realised he had been cheated and lodged a complaint with Hyderabad’s Cyber Crime Police Station. The student had arranged money by withdrawing from his father’s Provident Fund,police said.
The accused,Oazee Ewemade (32),Edoja Kennedy (34),Inneath Ambrose Amadin (32),Charles Omage (32),Emmanual Uyi (31) — all Nigerians — and Pooja Karmokar were nabbed on Saturday from their room in Mumbai’s MIDC area and produced before a local court the next day when Hyderabad Police were granted their transit remand of four days.
Amit had in March received an email stating he was randomly picked up as the winner for 7.5 lakh pounds.
“Amit was told to give all his personal details. The accused then called up Amit on his mobile phone and asked him to deposit a certain amount of money in an ICICI bank account number in Hyderabad which would be used for clearance of his prize money,” said Shashank Sandbhore,an Inspector with Mumbai Police’s Crime Intelligence Unit.
“Amit was again asked to deposit certain amount. In this manner,the victim had on different occasions deposited up to Rs 18.73 lakh,” Sandbhore said.
After the complaint,a Hyderabad police team came to Mumbai last week on getting information that the accused had been operating from the financial capital.
With the help of Mumbai Police,a trap was laid and the accused were rounded up from MIDC area. Further probe is on.

"An Indian national,who cheated unsuspecting women he met on internet dating sites and fleeced them of thousands of dollars,has been sentenced to 42 months in prison by a court in Philadelphia.
27-year-old Jaitass Dhanoa preyed on three women of Indian descent,lying to them about his name,citizenship,and employment and convinced them of his love before using their credit cards for the fraud,the Justice Department said.
He also used his name as Jay D Singh and Jay Singh.
Sentencing him for 42 months,a US District Court Judge ordered him to pay a USD 1,000 fine and a 1,500 special assessment.
Dhanoa used social networking sites like match.com and indiandating.com for picking up his potential victims.
He was charged with and pleaded guilty to three counts of aggravated identity theft,three counts of unauthorised use of an access device,eight counts of bank fraud,and one count of false representation of United States citizenship.
He entered the guilty plea in January this year.
Beginning in October 2007,Dhanoa used social networking sites,likehttp://www.indiandating.comandhttp://www.match.com,tomeet young women.
The accused,in an effort to seduce these women,lied about his name,his background,his citizenship,his employment,and his intentions,the Justice Department said.
Dhanoa,an Indian national,told his victims that he was a US citizen working for Deutche Bank and International Monetary Fund.
To further solidify this ruse,Dhanoa allegedly created fake Deutsch Bank email accounts and a fake American passport.
After gaining his victims’ trust,Dhanoa stole their credit cards which he then used without authorisation,and/or stole their identities which he then used to fraudulently obtain credit cards.
The three victims,who were each led to believe they were Dhanoa’s sole romantic interest,only found out about his scheme when they were contacted by credit card companies investigating suspicious activities,the Department said.
Since Dhanoa did not had any known prior criminal history,and accepted responsibility for his actions immediately after his arrest,the Justice Department recommended him in favour of a lower sentence.
The Department said Dhanoa carried out his scheme while dating at least three of his victims at the same time.
The defendant’s crimes are extremely serious,and merit and equally serious sentence,the federal investigators recommended.

"More than three months after programmers identifying themselves as Pakistan Cyber Army hacked its website and posted several comments,the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has zeroed in on two portals in the US and one in Latvia that were used for defacement. Moving a Delhi Court with Computer Emergency Response Team-India (CERT-In) report,the CBI has obtained permission from Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Vinod Yadav to approach authorities in the US and Latvia for collecting required information from technical incharge/ administrators/ web managers of the said portals. Their statements will be recorded so as to ascertain the users of the said IP addresses and to find out information pertaining to the hackers identity.
According to the report,the December 3 attack on the CBIs website had originated from the host IP address located at US and was used on that day at four different time periods between 5 and 10:10 pm,IST. The Who is details for the IP revealed that it belongs to Amazon.com Inc.,Amazon Web Services,South,Seattle,USA, stated the report. Adducing the investigation report into the case registered under the IT Act,the CBI said that one more IP address was found involved in the hacking. Another IP address has been found to be linked to the said defacement and Who is details of the same revealed it to be assigned to Network Operations Center Inc,Scranton,Pennsylvania (PA),US, read the report. This IP address,as per the CBI,was used for the first time in November,2010 and subsequently,on December 6,two days after the attack.
Narrating the modus operandi,the report stated the hackers accessed database server of the CBI website and managed to modify the database entries. The TITLE filed was replaced with a link containing hackers message and hence,their message was displayed in place of the actual news item in the website. The IP address reportedly led to DEACDCRIGAHOSTINGNET,Digitalas Ekonomikas Attistibas Centres 24 J. Riga in Latvia,while the free URL guided to Daugavpils,Latgale LV5401,Latvia.
Moving the court,the CBI sought issuance of letters of request to the US Department of Justice and Latvias Ministry of Justice for legal assistance. The CBI said that it was essential to get the user details of the three IP addresses in order to locate and ascertain the present whereabouts of the users and examine them on their role in the hacking. The application stated that besides drawing out necessary information from the incharges of the web portals to elicit names,addresses,e-mail addresses and other details of the users,certain documents and articles were also to be collected.
The CBI added that since India has an extradition treaty with the US,there would not be legal problems in conducting the prosecution. Along with the application,a letter of the Indian governments Ministry of Home Affairs showing assurance of reciprocity with the Ministry of Justice,Latvia,was also filed by the CBI.

"The Cyber Crime Investigation Cell of the Mumbai Police questioned actor Mandira Bedi’s husband Raj Kaushal on Saturday in connection with the rumours about broken cables on the Bandra Worli Sea Link.
In a tweet,Kaushal had urged people to avoid taking the sea link citing “broken cables”. He was questioned after Harihar Subramaniyam Iyer,assistant vice president of Hindustan Construction Company Ltd,registered a complaint against an unknown person for spreading rumours about the sea link.
Iyer also submitted printouts of Kaushal’s posts on Twitter cautioning people to avoid the sea link due to the alleged damage. Himanshu Roy,Joint Commissioner of Police (crime),confirmed that Kaushal had been called for questioning. “The questioning was based on the message submitted to us showing that Kaushal’s tweet was the first message sent on Twitter,” said Roy.
Asked if Kaushal would be booked,Roy said investigations were in progress.
According to Iyer’s statement,they received the message at 4:30 pm on March 23.  “I logged on toFacebookbut did not find anything. When my colleague Santosh Rai checked his profile on Twitter,he searched for the rumour and found that the first tweet was written by Kaushal.

"The AIIMS administration has lodged a complaint with the cyber crime cell of the CBI over the hacking of email accounts of two senior professors of the gynaecology department.
Senior AIIMS administration sources told Newsline that the step was taken after three absurd emails were sent from the email accounts of Professor Deepika Deka,wife of AIIMS director Dr R C Deka,and Professor Alka Kriplani.
Two of these emails,from the account of Dr Kriplani to Dr Deepika Deka,spoke of her superiority over HoD Dr Suneeta Mittal,and cited her proximity to the Dekas.
This email was forwarded from Dr Deepika Dekas email address to the faculty association,and other faculty members. The email also claimed that Dr Kriplani had influenced the appointment of the Director in return for a promise to be appointed the next HoD.
The second email was also sent from Dr Kriplanis account. This appeared to be leaking questions of the senior residency exam. The mail was sent to Reeta Mahey,petitioner in a Central Administrative Tribunal case against the institution and HoD Gynaecology,over alleged irregularities in the selection processes.
After CAT gave a clean chit to the institution,the petitioner approached the High Court  and fresh notices were issued on Wednesday.
While Dr Deepika Deka could not be contacted,Dr Kriplani confirmed that her account had been hacked.
Director Dr R C Deka,while confirming the email account hacking, said: The questions are from an old question paper of the institute. None of the questions in the mail match the question paper of this senior residency exam. The accounts of both doctors were hacked,and somebody has been sending these mails.
Sources told Newsline that while Dr Deepika Dekas email account was hacked about a month ago,Dr Kriplanis account was broken into a week ago.
After both doctors wrote to the administration,the institutes IT department was put on the job. When it failed to make any headway,the administration referred the matter to the CBI.

"Andhra Pradesh Police have roped in information technology experts to help investigating officers overcome lack of expertise in dealing with cyber crimes by training them.
Investigating Officers (IOs) were not adequately trained in investigation of cyber offences and collection of electronic evidence, said Additional Superintendent of Police (Cyber Crime) U Rama Mohan.
“Cyber crime inquiry requires tracking the offender who sends a particular e-mail or fraudulent bank transaction over the Internet. If the IO does not have the proper skill,he will find it difficult to track and nab the criminal,” he said.
Crime scene preservation,search and seizure of electronic evidence require a different approach than that of conventional method, added Mohan.
The police have taken up various training programmes with the help of experts in IT law. There are,however,practical problems in the enforcement of cyber law due to issues like jurisdiction,collection of evidence and inadequate knowledge of cyber laws, said Mohan.
Besides training police personnel to deal with new age crime,there was a need to orient judicial magistracy and prosecutors to appreciate the special conditions and technical aspects of evidence relating to cyber law,he said.
There is a need to be sensitised to appreciate the ‘electronic evidence’ presented in the courts. Some legal officers may not have proper knowledge of computer jargon like IP address,full header,hacking or e-banking,he said.
Certain offences like phishing (a practice of using fraudulent e-mails and copies of legitimate websites to extract financial data from computer users for purposes of identity theft) and cyber stalking may appear relatively new to some investigators,who need to be trained to deal with such cases,the officer said.
On the issue of jurisdiction,Mohan said the police operate within local boundaries,focusing on crime occurring within their area.
“But the global nature of Internet and cyber space brings together the offenders,victims and targets,who were otherwise situated in different countries,” he added.
Cyber offences often go beyond the purview of national boundaries,making it difficult for investigators to collect evidence and apprehend the culprit,he said.
The CrPC provides for writing Letter Rogatory (LR) and seeking information from abroad,and also processing requests coming in from other countries. But the process of securing evidence through LR is lengthy and time-consuming. This delay allows the offender to repeat his offences with impunity,said the officer.
The Government should have Mutual Legal Assistance treaties with a large number of countries to ensure speedy probe of cyber crime,said Mohan,who was a forensic expert.
At present,three cyber crime police stations are functional inAndhra Pradesh,which is an IT hub withHyderabadas the main centre. While the CID cyber crime station was set up in 2002,one in Hyderabad and another under the jurisdiction of Cyberabad Commissionerate were working since last year. The CID cyber crime station,which has jurisdiction of the entire state,has so far registered 169 cases under various Sections of IPC and Information Technology (IT) Act.
It has arrested 41 persons,including Nigerians,during the last four years in various cases including hacking,source code alteration and theft,debit card and ATM card fraud,publishing pornography and obscene text in the form of electronic photo,said Mohan.
Of the 41 persons,12 persons belonged to other states likeMaharashtra,Tamil Nadu,Delhi,Orissa andKarnataka,he said.

"The Reserve Bank of India on Tuesday cautioned individuals against responding to offers of money from abroad. Such offers are fraudulent and has advised the public to immediately register a complaint with the local police or cyber crime authorities when they receive such offers or become a victim of any such fraud,” said the central bank in an advisory.
It further clarified,RBI does not undertake any type of money arrangement,by whatever name called,and it does not take any responsibility for recovering moneys remitted in response to such bogus communication.”
It has also urged the Indian Banks Association and banks to educate their customers to be extra vigilant with regard to such fictitious offers. Banks have also been advised to take up with law enforcing agencies whenever accounts of their customers are misused for such fraudulent activities,” said RBI.
These fraudsters send attractive offers to gullible public through letters,e-mails,mobile phones and SMSes.
To lend credence to such offers,the communication is often sent on/ from letterheads or websites that appear to be like that of some public authorities like the RBI.
The offers are apparently signed by top executives of such authorities. However,only the names of the officials may be correct but their signatures are faked.

"The Union Government has decided to set up a state-of-the-art institute dedicated to churning out professionals and developing technologies to tackle cyber crime.
“The Union HRD Ministry recently took the decision to set up a state-of-the-art Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT),which would focus solely on strengthening cyber laws,producing cyber professionals trained to develop new software and technologies to fight the menace,” Director of the IIIT-Allahabad M D Tiwari said.
The decision was taken at a meeting held in New Delhi on January 24,attended by directors of the four existing IIITs of the country and HRD officials,Tiwari said.
“It was decided that the Institute would be built at a cost of Rs 100 crore on a Public-Private-Partnership model with IIIT-Allahabad playing the vital role of working out the details of this institute and its concept,” he said.
As per an estimate of the HRD Ministry,the country needs 2.5 lakh IT experts to tackle cyber crime,Tiwari said.
“Once the location for the new IIIT is finalised,the industrial sector,the Centre and the concerned state government are likely to share the expenses,” he said.
“While the Union HRD Ministry will be providing Rs 50 crore,the state will bear expenses worth Rs 35 crore by ensuring availability of land and other requisite facilities.
The Industry will chip in with the remaining Rs 15 crore,” he said.
He said IIIT-A was selected to play a vital role as it is the only IIIT to have expertise in the field of cyber law and even runs a postgraduate programme on the subject.
“The fact that we have a Rs seven crore IT Forensic Lab and many researches in the field to our credit also went in our favour,” he said.

"The Mumbai Police Crime Branchs Cyber Crime Investigation Cell on Friday arrested a 17-year-old student from Dhanbad for allegedly posing as a Pakistani and sending a threatening e-mail to Anil Ambani,chairman of the Reliance Anil Dirubhai Ambani Group,a week ago.
Police said the teenagers misguided motive behind sending the e-mail was allegedly an attempt to get the Government to take retaliatory action against Pakistan.
On January 15,Anil Ambani received an e-mail from jannuhm@rediffmail.com,issuing threats to him. ADAG lodged a complaint with the Crime Branch,and a case was registered on January 18. Investigations by the Cyber Crime cell revealed that the IP from which the e-mail had been sent was located in Harna in Gumah Road area of Nawagarh in Dhanbad. A team was sent to the location and the accused was arrested today. He had sent the e-mail from his personal computer, a Crime Branch officer said.  The accused has been charged under Sections of the Information Technology Act and with criminal intimidation under IPC. During preliminary interrogations,the accused has stated that he was angry as he felt that India had not taken any strong retaliatory action against Pakistan following the 26/11Mumbaiterror attack. He claims that he thought that if he posed as a Pakistani and issued threats to a prominent Indian citizen like Anil Ambani,India would take some retaliatory action, the officer said.

"The cyber crime cell of Pune police have booked three former employees of a Lohegaon tool making company  for allegedly stealing the patented designs of an “air plasma cutter tool” owned by the company and then manufacturing and selling the product,posing as company representatives. An engineer and a technician have been arrested while another engineer is at large.
As per the complaint filed by Arundhati Thomas,managing director of Plasma Technology in Khese Park,Lohegaon,three of their former employees — Deepak Gayake,Prafulla Kubetkar and Ashmi Sarawade – illegally copied the engineering designs of different parts of the air plasma cutter,such as that of the torch of the cutter and other consumables like electrode,nozzle,front cap and swirl. They had allegedly started doing business while working with the company. The stolen designs are from the 11 designs whose intellectual property rights are with Hughen Thomas,the chairman of the company.
After all the three left the company about two years ago they started manufacturing the tool and also started selling it to over 81 companies in India and abroad through their own units but working in tandem.
When Arundhati Thomas had a doubt about the three,she contacted the economic offences wing ofPunepolice from where she was directed to the cyber crime cell. Sangita Shinde-Alfonso,police inspector with the cell who is investigating the case said,Both Gayake and Sarawade are engineering graduates while Kubetkar is is trained in electrical works from ITI. After we got the information we carried out searches at three places where these three used to work.
She further said,We recovered different machines parts from these places. Our experts also retrieved the deleted engineering drawings,which are copies of the patented drawings,from Sarawade’s laptop. These will prove to be a very solid evidence against the three of them. We have arrested Kubetkar and Sarawade and the search for Gayake is on. The two arrested have been remanded to magisterial custody for 14 days. 
The three accused have been charged under sections 63 and 69 of the Copyright Act,1957 and section 103 of Information Technology Act for data theft. Indian penal code section 420 for cheating has also been invoked.
Speaking toThe Indian Express,Arundhati Thomas said,I am sure that this case will prove to be an example for people. Instead of approaching the court and then the court ordering the probe into the matter I directly approached the police and got an excellent support from them at all the levels. The teams and their experts have taken a lot of efforts in unearthing the truths of this multifaceted case. Right now police have recovered machines worth Rs 20 lakh. I am sure as the investigation progresses seizures of machines worth crores will take place.
Anant Shinde,additional commissioner of police (crime) said,This is certainly one of the significant case of copyright violation that we have been able to unearth in the recent past.

"The Cyber Crime Cell of the UT police is all set to file an untraced report in a case involving fraudulent withdrawal of money from a bank account without the owners knowledge. The case,under Section 70 of the IT Act,was registered in 2008 on the complaint of a Manimajra resident who was duped of Rs 85,500. More than 30 months of investigation could not yield any results,following which an untraced report will soon be filed in the court,the police said.
Atin Kapoor,a software professional,had moved a complaint with the Cyber Crime Cell of the UT Police in November 2007,alleging that he had found an amount of Rs 85,500 transferred to three other bank accounts using net banking services. Kapoor,who had an account with the ICICI Bank,had received an SMS alert about the transfer and found out that he had been duped.
While his netbanking password had been hacked,the money had been siphoned off from his account without his knowledge.
Following his complaint,the Cyber Crime Cell registered a case with the Manimajra police station on January 1,2008. As part of the investigation,all three bank accounts to which the money was transferred were verified and the police sent teams to all addresses of the account holders inMumbai.
However,all three addresses were found to be fake. The police also took no action against the bank,the addresses of whose account holders were found to be fake.
Best efforts were made by the police but our hands are tied when the addresses of the account holders are found to be fake. The accused grab the amount and flee as soon as the money is transferred. All addresses were raided and teams sent but no one lived at those addresses. As far as the bank and its responsibility to verify the accounts is concerned,they are not in our jurisdiction as the addresses were traced to Mumbai and Siliguri, said DSP (Crime) Satbir Singh.
Compensation given
While the police failed to make any headway in the case or to ascertain the identity of the fraudsters who had hacked the password and stolen the money,ICICI Bank compensated Kapoor of the amount. I got the shock of my life when I discovered Rs 85,500 transferred without my knowledge. There has been no update from the police side. Thankfully,the bank authorities have compensated me of the amount but it is still a mystery who hacked my account, said Kapoor.
3 similar cases
According to police sources,three other similar cases of fraudulent withdrawals are on the verge of being cancelled,with the police investigations making no headway. The case of the online lottery scam,in which former PEC Principal Sagar Sehgal was duped of Rs 23 lakh,has made no progress. Sehgal received an e-mail in December 2009 stating that he had won a Spanish lottery of Rs 56 crore.
He had transferred the money to nine different bank accounts. The police had raided the addresses of all nine bank accounts in Siliguri and Mumbai but all the addresses were found to be fake.
In June 2008 Saravanan,a resident of Sector 47,received an e-mail stating that he had won £45,000 in a random lottery in the UK. To take delivery of the amount,he was asked to pay Rs 41,200. In his case as well,the money was traced to an ICICI Bank account in Mumbai but no further lead could be made.
Another city resident,Vijay Rana,found that Rs 2.65 lakh had been transferred from his ICICI Bank account without his knowledge in June 2008. Later,he was informed that the transfer was made through his mobile banking account,which he had never activated. In this case too,the police are groping in the dark.

"The police have initiated action against unlicensed cyber cafes in the city following the revelation that the German Bakery blast conspiracy was hatched at an Udgir cyber cafe. Offences are being registered against such cafe owners.
A delegation ofPuneCentral Cyber Cafe Association,led by president Rahul Pokale,met Pune police commissioner Meeran Borwankar on Wednesday and requested her to cut down the action against cyber cafes. It also sought six months for these cafes to obtain licences. Borwankar,however,told the delegation that the police could not slacken their vigil as a cyber cafe in Udgir was used for terrorist activities.
Police sources said because of Deep Freeze  a software used to get rid of unwanted data,the data related to misuse of computer or Internet vanishes once the computer was shut down,making it difficult for them to trace such activities. Cyber cafe assoication president Kishor Chandavarkar said,Our machines are hampered if we dont use the software. We had requested the police to acquire technology that will enable them to recover the data that vanishes due to Deep Freeze… There are about 800 cyber cafes in the city. But only about 100 have got licences. The applications of 38 cafes are pending with the police. We requested them to give us six more months.
Additional Commissioner of Police (crime) Anand Shinde said,Cyber cafe regulation is properly done by the Pune police. Those violating the licence conditions are being booked.

"A physicist from the city,now based in the UK,Shahalam Siddiqui,has accused authorities of a Vadodara-based semi-government of hacking into his e-mail account and sending random mails for more than six months in 2004.
In a complaint filed in the Vadodara Sessions Court on Wednesday,Siddiqui stated that authorities of Sabari School,managed by Ayyapa Education Trust,had sent several job applications to random agencies in the UK from his personal and official accounts to prove that he was looking for a job there.
This,he said,was done with an intention to use these mails as evidence in the Gujarat State High Secondary Board Tribunal,which was hearing a dispute between the two.
Siddiqui came to know about this when the school authorities themselves gave this as evidence to his brother,Mehboob,now settled in Abu Dhabi.
He later filed a complaint of cyber crime with the J P Road police station,but the police closed the case saying he was falsely implicating the school authorities because of
the dispute about his unauthorised leave from the school.
The e-mail records,which were accessed byThe Indian Express,showed that the mails  sent after his accounts were hacked  had IP addresses of Vadodara,while Siddiqui was in the UK at that time.
Ayyappa Education Trust secretary J K Nair,who has been named in the complaint,told The Indian Express that the allegations were baseless.
He said he was not aware of the fresh complaint filed in the court,which,according Siddiquis counsel Kasim Kheemawala,is slated to be heard on September 8.
On the dispute with Siddiqui,he said: The matter is pending in the Gujarat State High Secondary Board Tribunal. He (Siddiqui) had left the school without getting his leave sanctioned twice. When we tried to contact him,he did not respond. Therefore,we filed a case against him. On his part,Siddiqui said he was having problems with the management from the day he joined the school,as he was a surplus teacher.
He alleged that Sabari School authorities were reluctant to take him after his previous semi-government school in Fatehgunj closed down. Siddiqui further said he joined the Institute of Physics in Kent (the UK) to concentrate on his research work on particle physics and semi conductors,which he was not able to do while serving as an assistant teacher in Vadodara.

"In yet another case of cheating through Internet,Deccan police have registered a case against two businessmen for duping 16 people through a website,whose domain name had been banned and sealed by government of Malaysia. No arrests have been made.
The complaint was filed by Jyotiram Shendge (30),resident of Vikroli. As per the complaint,Irfan Sayyad,(30),Kondhwa and Vijat Belad,(31),Bopodi,posed as managing directors of an investment firm Cash n Dollar and asked Shendge to invest money in it with a promise of 25 per cent return for 12 months and also gave back some installments of the money. Meanwhile,the complainant had introduced the duo to 15 other people and asked them invest money. The two collected a sum of Rs 22,59000 from these 15 people and disappeared. They had also posed to have an office at FC Road.
Sanjay Tungar,assistant police inspector with crime branch,said,After the registration of the website expired after getting banned,its domain name,www.cashndollar.biz ,again became available in the international market. Sayyad and Belad purchased that domain name using mail ID narenmalaysia03@yahoo.com. The IP address of the original website was registered in Malaysia. Right now we know that only 16 have been cheated .There could be many more who have been duped. We are investigating the case.
Sayyad and Belad have been charge under Sections 420,467,468 and 471 of Indian Penal Code for cheating and forgery. Police are yet to make arrests in the case.

"Many Ludhiana dating websites are promising their visitors a hot,sexy,charming boyfriend/girlfriend, irrespective of age,which as per the police,borders on cyber crime. They are also luring the youth by arranging meetings and dates,by giving the visitors the choice to select the time,date and place of their meeting.
A victim of such a city-based website said,I logged into one dating website and they asked me to open an account to get the best matches. I did that and they provided me with a list of boys,who were interested,along with their pictures. I liked one of them and we interacted for almost a month. Finally,we both decided to meet. When I actually reached the place,no one came. I waited for nearly three hours.
Some of these websites also offer the same services to people below 18 years of age. One such website calls itself the best website for underage singles. Another one is named Ludhianasingles ready to mingle. Some dating websites ask for money as well.
These websites can hack pictures and personal information of underage visitors for illegal purposes. Parents can play their part by putting passwords or using parental control option on such websites, said Rohan Sharma,an ethical hacking professional.
Ludhiana Police Commissioner Ishwar Singh said,Such websites are committing cyber crime and we can take action against them.

"The Internet,followed by removable devices like flashdisks and email,remained the major channels for distribution of malware and in the past quarter cybercriminals took advantage of software vulnerabilities,events such as the FIFA World Cup and the popularity of social media sites Twitter,Facebook  to proliferate computers,reveales a study by Trend Micro.
The report also mentions that spam messages that promise a prize or informing users that they won a certain lottery were common. To claim the said prize,it is must to provide personal information. FIFA and the Gaza attack were also employed in Twitter-related attacks that led to the download of malware. Trend Micro researchers also found a Twitter bot builder being distributed in the Internet for free, says the report.
Spam messages posing as newsletter from Amazon were also spotted. These bogus newsletters were sent from an alleged Amazon email address that tricked recipients into thinking they were real. Since most of the cyber attacks come from the Net,a team working 24/7 for critical data is essential. Phishing is still active in the marketplace,which means old methods never die,they just get updated, says Amit Nath,Country Manager,India and SAARC,Trend Micro.
The study states that cyber criminals are deploying new techniques faster than ever. Infrastructure,applied in cloud computing,to protect data and keep personal information secure is significant. As usual,cybercriminals also leveraged on software vulnerabilities: Adobe Reader (TIFF file),Skypecomponent – EasyBits Extras Manager,MicrosoftWindows Help Center,and Adobe Flash Player to lead users to a series of malware infection, says the report.
At present,KOOBFACE is the largest Web 2.0 botnet that employes various social networking sites for its social engineering ploy. As many as 100,000 websites that include some leading websites were compromised, says the report.

"The cyber crime cell of the Mumbai Police recently arrested a 20-year-old student for allegedly hacking into a friends social networking forum and e-mail accounts,and posting obscene messages about her. According to the police,the accused posted the message out of spite following an argument between the two.
Saurav Krishnakumar Singhal is a businessmans son residing in Lokhandwala. The victim who was a close friend of him stayed in the same building and used to visit his apartment frequently.
According to the police,Singhal and the victim often used to visit each others residences. Taking advantage of this,Singhal hacked the victimsfacebookandgooglemail accounts and posted an obscene message about her.
On April 13,Singhal informed the girl that someone had posted a lewd message about her. When she tried to open her facebook account,she realised she could not open it as her password had been altered. On trying to log in to her gmail account,she found she could not access it for the same reason, revealed a source.
Two days later,when Singhal asked the victim what she would do about the issue,she said that she would take up the matter with the police. Singhal then tried to dissuade her by saying that he knew a friend who could hack into the accounts and retrieve the passwords, said the source.
Following this,when the victim tried to access her facebook account again,she was successful. However,she was unable to log in to her gmail account. At this stage,the victim became suspicious about Singhals role in the matter and she approached the cyber police station. The police began probing the case,and traced the IP (internet protocol) address from which the obscene message had been initially posted to a computer in Singhals residence. On July 12,the police raided Singhals residence,seized his hard disk and arrested him.

"Small budgets,needless focus on design and ethical hacking make them vulnerable,say cops
In a bid to tackle the possibility of phishing and data theft from websites of state universities and colleges,especially during the admission process,the Cyber Crime Cell ofAhmedabadDetection of Crime Branch (DCB) has decided to offer solutions to educational institutes.
The websites of universities and colleges are vulnerable to cyber crime,the DCB said. A recent incident of data tampering of the Gujarat University website by a Rajkot student revealed the flaws in web security maintained by the educational institutes.
Inspector Kiran Patel of the cell said small budgets and needless focus on presentation has led to the vulnerability of the educational websites.
He said: The websites of small institutes perhaps do not use proper security software and large institutes give more importance to making their websites more accessible. They want maximum students to use their website in short  time. They design websites that do not take much time to load and are attractive for students and end up paying no attention to security.
The DCB has decided to call web developers from the institutes and help them with security solutions. They will be briefed on the flaws in their security system and utility of various software that can help them secure data and procure them.
Another factor that has triggered the youths to go for hacking university websites is the practice of teaching ethical hacking in computer classes in Ahmedabad.
Patel said: Recently,computer institutes have taken a fancy to teaching ethical hacking. This course teaches students methods to hack using codes. Although the intention of running these courses is good,it is proving harmful.
He added: The youths who learn these courses are hired by many companies for their security as these students are experts in detecting data tampering and phishing. But some classes are also giving certain codes for hacking,which is a dangerous practice.
The DCB said during the period,when admission processes are underway,many technocrats are working to tamper with the data of colleges and universities. The DCB officials said the students need to be aware of dubious websites,specially the ones that run information on entrance examinations and online admissions. They collect fees in the name of some fake institutes.

The Government will ensure that cyber connectivity reaches all corners of the state,but a system of lodging email complaints needs to be established as soon as possible,he said at the inauguration of the Mumbai Police Cyber Safety Week.
Cyber criminals are likely to be ahead of us as the technology rapidly gets updated. Its essential that we gain access to the latest technology needed to combat cyber criminals. It is heartening to see that our police force is also gradually getting cyber-savvy,as more and more constables who have enrolled recently have good knowledge of computers, Patil told IT professionals and senior police officials at the Y B Chavan Auditorium,Nariman Point.
He said young officers and personnel,with their grasp of the latest technology,should be roped in to tackle cyber crime.
Its essential that even the poor get access to cyberspace and the Government will ensure that it is done in a subsidised manner, he said.
The KMPG group released the results of a study on the citys wireless networks; of 28,000 networks discovered,66 per cent were highly protected while the rest had low or no protection. While 60 per cent of business networks were not or poorly protected,only 48 per cent of home networks lacked proper protection. Around 5,000 networks were found with default manufacturer network names.

"Lyricist and poet Javed Akhtar complained to Cyber Crime Cell of the Mumbai police on Saturday that he has received a death threat in an e-mail,which also criticises him for his comments against the fatwa on Muslim women issued by some Muslim clerics in Deoband.
The fatwa was reportedly against Muslim women as earning members of the family.  During a panel discussion on a television channel on May 11,I had strongly opposed the supposed fatwa… supposed because some time later,the body had denied that they had issued any such fatwa. However after that comment,I began receiving several e-mails protesting my comment and on May 12,I received an e-mail from Aneesul Islam threatening me with dire consequences. It was a long e-mail that stated that it was my last warning and I wont be able to save myself henceforth. I left for Kerala the next day and returned on Friday. At my friends and my wife Shabanas behest,I lodged a complaint with the Cyber Crime police station at BKC, said Akhtar.
However,the man to whom the e-mail id belongs has sent another mail to Akhtar claiming that his account had been hacked into. I have received another mail from the same id and the sender has vehemently denied that he has sent the threat mail to me. He also claims to be a victim as his id was also hacked into and misused. The investigation will reveal who is responsible, said Akhtar.
Even as Crime Branch officials said the investigations were in progress,Additional Commissioner of Police (West Region) Amitabh Gupta said two policemen had been deputed to provide security to Akhtar.

"The Cyber Cell of Mumbai Police on Thursday arrested a senior Army officer for allegedly downloading pornographic pictures and clips of children and then uploading them on certain websites.
Lieutenant Colonel Jagmohan Balbir Singh (42) was arrested from Colaba and booked under the Information Technology Act.
Acting on a report last September by the German police to Interpol stating transmission of child porn videos through a server,the international police body traced the server to India after which a report was submitted to the CBI in Delhi in March 2010,police sources said. The CBI had then directed theMumbaiCrime Branch to investigate.
We traced the IP address to Singhs house in Namdar Manzil,Colaba. Cyber cell officers visited the house on Thursday. Singh admitted to having downloaded porn and uploaded them on certain sites, said Joint Commissioner of Police,Crime,Himanshu Roy. During preliminary interrogation,Singh said he had been surfing child porn sites for the past few years, he added.
On Friday,the Crime Branch sought Singhs custody saying they wanted to find if he had any international or local accomplices or uploaded the videos on other sites.
After a two-month investigation,we concluded Singh was involved in a porn racket,which could involve foreigners. Most pictures were of foreign children,all of a tender age of 3-4 years, said Investigating Officer Mukund Pawar.
In court,Singhs lawyer Dilip Bagwe argued that his clients custody was not required as police had already seized the evidence. Singh is a serving Army officer… and would not abscond… Even an attempt to dogde police will be like an open invitation for court martial, Bagwe argued.
The court granted the police Singhs custody till May 12. Officials said the Cyber Cell had seized two hard disks of 80 GB from Singhs residence in which over 150 files on child pornography were stored. Officials said Singh had purchased the software to download and post the content on free websites.
We had been keeping a watch on his house but did not find anyone besides his family visiting him. After ensuring it was the computer at his place which was being used,we raided his house on Thursday night, said an official.
Incidentally at the time of the raid,his computer was in the process of downloading more material. We were at his house for over six hours. He also spoke to us about how and where he uploaded the images and videos. While he seemed to be aware of technicalities of the process,he appeared to be surprised that downloading and dissemination of the images is a crime, he added.
Roy said they would interrogate Singh to find where he procured the content and whether any were created by him. Prima facie,the websites he uploaded content are voyeuristic rather than soliciting in nature. We will procure his bank and credit card details to ascertain whether he paid a membership, he said.
Singh has been in the Army for 22 years and has been with its Supply and Transport Wing in Colaba.
An Army spokesperson said he is on study leave and has been staying in Mumbai with his family for two years now. The Army has applied for his bail so that they could proceed with their own investigation.

"Come summer vacations and parents have one more reason to worry about for their naughty children,who apart form picking a fight with other kids or breaking a neighbour’s window pane while playing cricket,could also innocently invite trouble over the Internet.
During school holidays kids are likely to spend more time on the Internet than perhaps they normally do and thus become an easy prey for cyber criminals,say internet security experts.
Besides being exposed to malware,online scams and illegal content,including pornography,innocent children also have threatened by online stalkers who indulge in cyber bullying and identity theft.
“Children and youth present a vulnerable target. As most schools in India are closed for vacations,it is obvious that the youth will have more time on hand to surf the web,with little or no supervision.
Although they are internet-savvy and increasingly use the medium to gather information,for socialising and recreation,yet they are naive and inexperienced,” cautions Siobhan MacDermott,senior vice-president of security software maker AVG Technologies.
With ready access to the Internet through their home computers,schools and even cyber-cafes and mobile phones,teens and pre-teens are increasingly spending their time online.
According to a survey conducted by the TCS across 12 Indian cities last year,63 per cent of urban students spend over an hour online daily and 62 per cent have a personal computer at home.
Over 80 per cent find time for the internet alongside school,classes and extra-curricular activities,and are starting to embrace Web 2.0 tools like blogs and social networking sites,the report says.
As internet penetration increases,cyber crime cells across the country are increasingly receiving complaints of children being victimised on the World Wide Web.
“Teenagers can easily be lured to reveal their personal details and credit card information leading to siphoning off money from accounts. Besides they might also be exposed to content against their family values,” warns Sanjay Bahl,chief security officer of software makerMicrosoftIndia.
The largest threat,however,comes from the usage of social networking websites such asFacebookand Orkut.
“A sexual predator could easily establish a false identity and masquerade as a young girl online to gain the trust of young children. Without using common sense and examining the profile photos,it is difficult identifying online predators,” he says.
Earlier this month,a class eight girl student in Agra had suddenly discovered that someone had hacked her Facebook profile and posted vulgar content. This led to huge social embarrassment for the teenager,who had all her school friends on the social networking website.
“We get such complaints from teachers and guardians quite regularly. Many a times it is found to be a case of bullying by a classmate. When friends have a falling out or even just a simple disagreement,many turn to the internet to seek revenge,as it is possible to hide behind a computer,” says Rakshit Tandon,a cyber security consultant with the Agra Police.
“Young brains rattle off everything on community websites. If a child’s profile says that he has a car and a bungalow in a posh area,he indicates that he belongs to a rich family. Now when he updates his friends that he is feeling lonely at home today after his parents are out to attend a party,the child will obviously invite the attention of online stalkers,” he warns.
In 2007,16-year-old Adnan Patrawala,the son of a rich businessman,was killed inMumbaiby his abductors,who had befriended him on Orkut through a fake profile.
Moreover,downloading of various pirated content like music or movies is another issue which might find kids on the wrong side of the law.
“The youth often use peer-to-peer sharing platforms to download songs,movies and other content,which are common ways for illegal content to be distributed. This type of content includes copyrighted work and work that is published without the author’s permission,” says the AVG official.
Tandon,who has conducted safe surfing campaigns for around 3.25 lakh school children across 42 cities under the patronage of the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI),admits that awareness is a big issue with kids.
“Children do not know that they break the law and can be punished for bullying someone on the internet or downloading pirated works. They need to be educated properly on the pros and cons of using the internet,” he stresses.
As children are generally unaware of the repercussions of inadequately protecting their identity online,it becomes the responsibility of the parents to ensure that they do not face a difficult situation.
“The best way to keep safe is to firstly develop amongst children a healthy dose of awareness and scepticism,and then to back that up with security software that includes a dedicated web-scanning layer,and behaviour-blocking technology,” says Microsoft’s Bahl.
However,the old techniques of parental control have often been found to be ineffective in India as kids are generally more tech-savvy then their parents. Even if the parents use parental controls,children today will likely know how to disable them.
“The responsibility,therefore,lies also with the teachers. Why can’t children be taught inside classrooms on how to use the web for a safe and trouble-free experience?
Some parents try to block the usage of internet,which doesnt deserve any merit,” says Tandon.

"Around three in every four global companies believe they have adequate policies in place to protect consumers’ personal information,even though more than half of them have lost sensitive data within the past two years,a survey by IT consultancy Accenture has said.
According to the global study,there is a stark difference between organisations’ intentions regarding data privacy and how they actually protect sensitive personal information,such as name,address,date of birth,race and medical history.
“Nearly three-quarters (73 per cent) of organizations believe they have adequate policies in place to protect sensitive,personal information,yet more than half have lost sensitive data within the past two years,” the study stated.
The study found 58 per cent of business respondents have experienced at least one data security breach over the past two years and nearly 60 per cent of these organizations acknowledge data loss as a recurring problem.
The study,conducted in conjunction with information security research firm Ponemon Institute,surveyed more than 5,500 business leaders and 15,500 consumers in 19 countries.
“Volume of sensitive personal information being collected and shared by organisations has grown exponentially in recent years,making data protection a critical business issue and not just a technology concern,” Accenture’s security practice managing director Alastair MacWillson said.
While 70 per cent agreed that organisations have an obligation to take reasonable steps to secure consumers’ personal information,there are discrepancies in their commitments for doing so,it added.
The study revealed that biggest causes of data losses are internal problems relating to a company’s ability to detect and correct.
For instance,business or system failure (57 per cent) and employee negligence or errors (48 per cent) were cited most often as the source of the breaches,while cyber crime was cited as a cause of only 18 per cent of security breaches,the study said.

"The second police station dealing with cyber crime in the state would come up in the city soon. This was announced by Vadodara Police Commissioner Rakesh Asthana. Ahmedabad already has the states first such police station.
Two police stations in Vadodara are going to have two inspectors said Asthana,adding that a voluntary community policing initiative named Hawk Eye has been launched by Vadodara police and involves street vendors.
The new cyber crime police station,according to Asthana,would be headed by an officer of deputy superintendent rank and will be assisted by an inspector and sub-inspectors. The plan to start a new cyber crime police station has been approved by the Home Department. This will hopefully tackle various cyber crimes in the city, added Asthana.
The city police chief also elaborated on project Hawk Eye launched nearly a fortnight ago. Community policing would be divided in various clusters where a street vendor would be encouraged to pass on information about any incident, he said.
Meanwhile,Jetalpur road and Makarpura police stations would be bifurcated with two inspectors as heads. This has been done keeping in mind the communally sensitive nature of the two areas and staff shortage, added Asthana.

"There has been a rise in cybercrime complaints this year. In January-February,Pune police received 82 against 64 during the same period in 2009. The cyber forensic lab has been solving cases ranging from locating a woman who had run away from her husband after harassment to tracing two missing girls.
Deputy Commissioner of Police (cyber crime cell) Rajendra Dahale said,272 complaints were registered in 2009. Complaints increased after the amendment of the Information Technology (IT) Act. Credit card frauds and online frauds are the most frequent cyber crimes…
According to additional commissioner (crime) A D Shinde,the cyber forensic lab started at the police commissionerate in December 2009 is playing a key role in solving cases. He said besidesPunepolice,the lab has helped the Satara,Aurangabad and even Chennai police in solving cases.
In a notable case,Pune resident Gurupreet Singh on February 26 filed a complaint that his sister had run away from her husband in Nairobi in Kenya after harassment by in-laws. She had sent an email to Gurupreet saying she would commit suicide. The cyber crime cell found she had sent the email from a cyber café inLucknow. The information was passed on to Gurupreet,who went to Lucknow and rescued her.
In another case,the cyber crime cell helped Chennai-based Rajesh Bohra to trace his two sisters missing since February 11. Bohra lodged a report with Vadalpalani police in Chennai. Chennai police contacted the cyber crime cell,Pune. The hard disc of Bohras computer was sent to lab. From leads,police confirmed that Bohras sisters were in Mohali,Punjab. Bohra went there and found his sisters.

"Terming the use of networking sites such as ‘Facebook’ as anti-Islamic,a top Egyptian cleric has issued a fatwa against it saying Muslims using such cyber platforms must be considered “sinners”.
And the cleric went to extent of blaming such sites for growing incidents of marital discords in the country.
Noted Sunni scholar Sheikh Abdel Hamid al-Atras,former head of the fatwa commission at prestigious Al-Azhar University here,issued the fatwa saying such sites have resulted in rise of the marital infidelity.
“It’s an instrument that destroys the family because it encourages spouses to have relations with other people which break Islamic Sharia law,” he said in the fatwa.
“While one or other of the spouses is at work,the other is chatting online with someone else,wasting their time and flouting the Sharia. This endangers the Muslim family,” said al-Atrash.
The fatwa came after a study earlier this week claimed that one in every five cases of divorces in Egypt had been caused after one of the partners started using social networking sites such asFacebook.
Last month,Grand Mufti of Egypt Ali Jumah condemned the practice of using Quranic verses as the mobile ringtones terming it as “improper” as it compromises the sacredness of the religious scriptures.

"Indian IT companies,cyber crime experts and the police have for the first time kicked off a collaborative effort to prevent multi-million dollar losses due to cyber crimes,including data theft and cyber terrorism in the country.
Modelled on the FBI-funded National Cyber Forensics Training Alliance in the United States,the Indian collaborative effort is being piloted by the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) and aims to pool resources and experience from companies and police agencies to combat cyber crime.
Cyber security enforcement in the country has largely been carried out through Cyber Labs set up in different cities by NASSCOM.
We need a quantum leap on the Cyber Lab model that trains around 3000 people on cyber security every year. We need a virtual group of experts like the US NCFTA. A group that collects and shares knowledge on facets of cyber crime, says Prathap Reddy,an IPS officer fromKarnatakawho is now advisor to NASSCOM.
This week,Reddy used the third anniversary celebration of the countrys first Cyber Lab located inBangaloreto rally support from private sector IT experts for a public-private alliance.
The IT industry is looking for such a collaboration but does not know how to go about it, Prathap Reddy said. The Indian cyber crime alliance will also establish ties with international agencies like the NCFTA in the US,he said.
We are willing to offer a second line of people on deputation to technically assist investigators of cyber crimes, said Chellam Raju,a security expert with Fidelity,which operates in India and is part of the US cyber forensics alliance.
Globally,in 2009 alone losses due to cyber crimes have been estimated at $109 billion. In India,among the chief concerns of the outsourcing dependent IT and ITES industry has been issues of data theft.Unlike in the US,where it is mandatory to put in the public domain details of cyber offences,Indian companies have not been very open about security breaches because of the fear of adverse industry reactions.
Cyber law enforcement agencies in India have found it tough to nail perpetrators,with offenders often based overseas. In Karnataka out of 307 cyber offences registered since 2000,charge sheets have been filed only in 65 cases and no punishments have been ordered,says director general of police of the state CID D V Guruprasad. Karnatakas IT secretary Ashok Kumar Manoli said his department was willing to fund the initiative in return for expertise from the alliance.

"Phishing,it seems,has not spared even Income Tax department. The Ministry of Finance has issued a notice asking the income tax payers to ignore e-mails asking credit card details while informing the tax payers of the refunds,said Sanjeev Shah,Vadodara-based cyber crime expert in Ahmedabad.
Shah,a chartered accountant,said this while giving a presentation on Recent amendments to tackle cyber crime at a meet organised by the Indian Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) at itsAhmedabadbranch on Thursday.
Shah has been making similar presentations in different parts of the state. The notice (402/92/2006-MC 23 of 2009) brought out by the Ministry of Finance has asked the tax payers to ignore mails sent by two fake Income-Tax staff from lhxbkw@accounts.net and cvhfvs@accounts.net, said Shah.
The notice also says several people hoping to get tax refunds have lost money after revealing their credit card details while corresponding with the senders of these mails. The notice further cautions that if anyone corresponds to the e-mails,it would be on his or her own risk. Every week I get at least two to three calls about people having fallen prey to these e-mails and now SMSs, said Shah. People are not innocent when they reply to such mails. There is a promise of money and they fall for it. Some immediately withdraw when the sender asks for a processing fee that can go as high as Rs 50,000. Others pay this, said Shah. Shahs team comprises lawyers and software engineers and has undertaken the task to train police forces in tackling the menace of phishing.
He said he has trained police departments in Haryana,Delhi,Maharashtraand recently Vadodara region.

"The New Year begins with more stringent laws for cyber cafés in Gujarat. Nearly 70 per cent of the cyber café owners will not be able to get their licenses renewed as the new Information Technology Amendment Act (ITAA),2009 makes it mandatory for them to store customers surfing data for three years.
At present,it is mandatory for cyber cafes to maintain visitors identity proofs and a daily register recording their names,addresses,telephone numbers,and time of logging in and logging off. But now,they will have to keep the record of the websites visited too. cyber café owners have,however,said it is practically impossible for them to store so much data.
At a symposium on Recent amendments to tackle cyber crimes through cyber laws-2009, cyber Law expert Sanjeev Shah said cyber cafes have been named as intermediaries in Section 67 (C) of the Act. They have been asked to store the details of the content viewed by each person for at least three years, said Shah,adding that non-complaince could invite imprisonment up to five years or a fine,or both.
Shah said there was a case in Gujarat University where a girl sent an email from the US,accusing her Ph D guide of raping her in the hostel. But from what I have found out, the mail was sent by one of her  university colleagues when she was studying here. This is called an abuse email and it has also been covered under the new Act, he said.
The new IITA Amendment Act also gives more powers to the government. The government has full right to intercept,monitor and decrypt any computer resource they want, said Shah. The new Act has been introduced to tackle new cyber crimes like phishing,abuse mails,data theft and data sabotage,video voyeurism,online frauds,identity frauds,child pornography and cyber terrorism.

"In a bid to upgrade cyber security in the city,the Kolkata Police has decided to set up a police station dedicated to cyber crime investigation. The Kolkata Police today launched a website (< http://kolkatapolice-cybercampaign.net >) to educate the public on cyber crime and ways to prevent it. Citizens can lodge their complaints and register their queries on the site as well.
Cyber crime is increasing by the day. With newer and more sophisticated technologies evolving,cyber-criminals are enjoying a free run. To check the menace,we have decided to have a police station that will be dedicated to cyber-crime cases. In addition,we have launched a website today in which people can easily file their complaints. The data will be kept secret, said city Police Commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakraborty.
The cyber crime police station will be the fourth of its kind in the country,the other three being inBangalore,HyderabadandMumbai. The new police station will be located on the premises of theKolkataPolice headquarters in Lalbazar.
On Monday,we will place the proposal before the state government and the police station will be operational soon, said Chakraborty.
Several IT giants in the city,includingWipro,TCS andIBM,have been involved in supplying the expertise to run the cyber crime police station,which will operate round-the-clock and register cyber crimes.
The cyber crime police station will have a group of advisers who will work with investigating agencies. We have 141 volunteer IT experts who will work with the police to update the website and to reply to queries of people registered in the website, said a senior police official.
Meanwhile,following the recent terror alert issued by the Union Home Ministry,the police have stepped up security in the city and owners of the cyber cafes have been asked to install a special software supplied by the Kolkata Police in their computers.
We have floated tenders for preparing software that will capture the image of the user and save the details of the users. Earlier,all the cyber café owners were asked to maintain a register to keep a record of the customers. But through the software,we will be able to have digital information about the users. We are consulting our legal advisers to make the software mandatory for all the cyber cafes in the city, added Chakraborty.
Instead of installing CCTVs in important places in the city,the Kolkata Police has switched over to the Intelligence Surveillance System (ISS). The CCTVs can only capture images. The ISS will comprise a software,which will provide us with special intelligence input. The government has already allotted funds for the project, said Chakraborty.

"The growing popularity of cloud computing and virtualisation among companies could lead to them being the next possible target of cyber criminals. According to a report brought out by  Trend Micro,a company that specialises  in internet security,cloud computing,while offering significant benefits and cost-savings, moves servers outside the traditional security perimeter making it easy for the reach of cyber criminals.
The industry already witnessed ‘danger’ or ‘sidekick’ due to the cloud-based server failure that caused major data outages in November 2009,highlighting cloud-computing risks that cybercriminals are likely to abuse.
According to the report,cyber criminals will either be manipulating the connection to the cloud or attacking the data centre and cloud itself. The next-generation protocol designed by the Internet Engineering Task Force,Internet Protocol (v. 6),is still in the experimentation stages of replacing the current (IPv4),now 20 years old. As users start to explore the new protocol so will cyber criminals. Possible avenues for abuse include new covert channels, said Amit Nath,country manager,India and SAARC,Trend Micro.
The quality and quantity of data posted openly by most trusting users on their profile pages,combined with interaction clues are more than enough for cybercriminals to stage identity thefts and targeted social engineering attacks. The situation will worsen in 2010 with high-profile personalities suffering from online impersonators or stolen bank accounts, the report says.

"If an individual sends an SMS to another that the latter finds objectionable,he could file a criminal complaint against the sender. The SMS sender would then be booked under relevant provisions of Section 66 (A to F) of the Information Technology Act (Amended),2008,that came into effect on October 27,2009.
To tackle rising number of cyber crime cases that have now become criminal offences,Commissioner of Police Satyapal Singh on Saturday issued an order for setting up cyber squads at all 28 police stations in the city. Earlier,there was only one cyber crime cell at the police commissionerate.
Citizens can now file complaints at local police stations instead of rushing to the commissionerate,Singh said. Each squad will have a police sub inspector and at least two constables who will work under an inspector,he said.
The offence in such cases would be cognisable and not non-cognisable as was the case in the past, DCP (cyber crime) Rajendra Dahale said on Monday. Before the Act was amended,the complaints in cyber cases were mostly civil in nature that entailed compensation and damages. We used to file chapter cases which are filed in case of non-cognisable cases. Henceforth,we will file cognisable complaints which means the crime is serious in nature, he said.
Citing cases like sending text messages that some people might call objectionable,Dahale said,If an individual objects to an SMS which questions his integrity or hurts his dignity or finds it malicious or threatening,he can file a criminal complaint against the sender. This means,people will have to be cautious while sending an SMS.
The case of Nigerian frauds that inform an individual through an SMS that he has won a lottery would amount to cheating,he added. A cheating case which entails a jail term could be filed against the senders, he said.

"Rohini trader downloaded photos of airhostesses from Facebook: cops
A Rohini-based trader has been arrested for allegedly downloading photographs of two city-based airhostesses from a social networking site and e-mailing their morphed obscene versions to the duos friends and colleagues.
The Delhi Polices Special Cell arrested the suspect,Jitender Singh Rana,30,from his house in Rohinis Sector-3 on Wednesday,the police said on Friday.
Newsline had reported about the crime in its Friday edition.
A senior officer said the suspect came to know the victims through a common friend but fell out after a fight earlier this year. He allegedly tried to resolve the issue over the months but did not succeed. Thereafter,he committed this crime to teach them a lesson, the officer said. In their early 20s,the women are employees of Jet Airways.
According to the police,Rana downloaded photos of the women from their accounts in the social networking siteFacebookand morphed the images. He then e-mailed the obscene images to the victims friends and colleagues on their Facebook and Orkut accounts,according to the officer.
Rana,according to the complaint,also posted the morphed images on a blog. He used two e-mail accounts in Gmail to circulate these images,the officer said. The victims approached the police after their friends told them that they had received e-mails containing their pictures.
The Special Cell registered a case under the Information Technology (IT) Act-67 based on the complaint. Rana,a graduate in hotel management,is married and has a child.
